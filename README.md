### Eric's Blog

This is a Next.js blog for which I primarily update the public directory. I've been writing on this site for the last seven years, and the projects and small notes constitute a large part of my online identity. In the past, I worried a lot about not being able to write longform content, but after taking several classes at brown -- in journalism, entrepreneurship, and creative nonfiction, I'm more confident that if I have a longer piece to articulate, I could do it here.

I hope to be able to release more written posts; who the audience for this is has been a longstanding and problematic question. Maybe the best person to see this site would be a younger version of myself. Certainly, if I end up giving any kind of useful address its very helpful to have someone in mind.

As for the shortform content, I try to highlight aspects of the world, from miniscule fragments and linguistic puzzles to longer fragments of literature, science, and art, which uniquely apply to me.

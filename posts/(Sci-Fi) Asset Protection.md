Our attorney told us the bad news yesterday.

Earnestness, she says, is falling out of favor. The only thing that she thinks has any real potential anymore is playing off of specialization, maybe even an artistic specialization. But that's not an easy pivot for me. 

I've been working towards shotgun pre-professional for the past eight years, with the standard empathy complexes. Not quite full shotgun but a balanced set of time sinks, generic enough but not too generic. The type that usually gets safe 0.03-0.04% adjusted yields across the board, year after year. 

But my silver bullet was supposed to be Earnestness.

And it would have worked great in the past. But this year the rumors really are true: with the huge increases in applicants using asset protection, colleges are having second thoughts about the effectiveness of their Earnestness evaluations. The latest simulations show a massive reversal in the qualities which the applicant classifiers select for. Earnestness is projected to go down by 87%.

Why is my portfolio so Earnestness focused? To tell you the truth, it's my grandparents fault. The years they applied to college, some sixty years ago, colleges began their shift to the current system, discarding primitive metrics like the SAT and applicant essays in favor of more comprehensive, black-box solutions. That was the same year that the College Board announced its partnership with Google.

Colleges began using applicant classifiers, deep learning models which college admissions officers adjusted year to year. By filing information requests, the public slowly uncovered the hyperparameters which the models looked for in applicants. There was Academic Potential, Creative Intent, Technical+: all of the metrics which are discussed intensely today on college forums and discourse channels.

And of course, there was Earnestness, the big data version of the College Board's old adversity score. Like the adversity score, it measured how much an applicant "deserved" their academic success, but it used massive amounts of data to do so. Your zip code, your family income, the crime rate in your neighborhood: but also your social media posts, your fitness data, your religious and political activity. 

The College Board believed that the previous adversity score had failed because it hadn't given a complete enough picture of people's lives. Using more data, they reasoned, could help Earnestness succeed where the adversity score had failed.

My grandparents came from upper-middle class families. They hadn't put a lot of thought into the application process, expecting their hard work and passion to shine through naturally. Like so many others in that first generation, they saw their own college applications ruined by low Earnestness scores. They didn't get into their top choices -- on my mom's side, my grandmother didn't get into *any* college -- and they all suffered greatly, living off of unemployment and working odd jobs through the recessions in the 30's. It was tough, but they made it through.

Scarred by their experiences, both sides of my family drilled the importance of improving Earnestness into their kids from the moment they were born. Even at that time, some thirty years ago, they were the rare families who got college counselors focused on personal experience, and not on test scores. My own parents went to the right public schools, worked the right blue-collar jobs (McDonalds, Home Depot), rejected the right internships. They shunned private school kids and rich neighborhoods, even as their families started to make decent money.
My parents and their counselors established all of the classic Earnestness tricks we use today. 

On my dad's side, my grandparents paid for an emotive experience off the charts even by today's standards -- spending a summer in the Alaskan wilderness going fishing and reading Thoreau. My mom spent time on a farm where she could tend to the goats. Both of their social media accounts were stripped down, all of their photos delisted or filtered so as to be unreadable by the college web trawlers. My parents took DNA tests, tracked down missing relatives with possible hereditary conditions. My mom's family found a second cousin who had died from lung cancer. It all boosted my parents Earnestness scores, made them perfectly imperfect to the applicant classifiers. You couldn't study for the Earnestness evaluations -- but you could still cheat it.

Those counselors played the game perfectly for my parents, and they set the scene for the flourishing asset protection industry we know today. My grandparents love talking about how they were the early adopters, how they learned from their own mistakes and brought my parents great success.

They tell me the story about how the asset protection industry got its name. Back in the early days, families of college applicants would hire asset protection attorneys, versed in financial law, to hide records of their wealth, so that colleges would think they had less money than they actually did. That way, they could receive more financial aid from the college.

In essence, that is what asset protection does today. But instead of just hiding money, asset protection attorneys today hide everything that might affect our Earnestness scores. Instead of reading FAFSA and financial aid policy, they study the human-legible parts of classifier patterns to help us create authentic portfolios. They help us pretend to live the imperfect lives that colleges look for.

Our family eats high carbohydrate diets and very little meat, and we live in the outskirts of a logging town which we moved to after eighth grade. Our family has few books (all romance and pulp fiction) registered online; I sneak Woolf and Shakespeare late at night, after I wash dishes (the biometrics pick it up). The books that I really like to read must wait for car rides, when the bumps prevent accurate scans. My attorney and parents dictate my friendships (ethnically diverse, low middle class, with small but loveable quirks). I alternate my time between the children's hospital, taking care of my younger brother, my part-time job at a Mexican restaurant and my Scouting Troop. I have never broken a promise, missed a meeting, or failed to arrive early to an interview. 

My parents trusted in Earnestness. It's like a religion to them. It worked for them. My dad, who got into Tufts, and my mom, who got into a UC-SC, say cliched stuff like "the market optimizes for authenticity". "Earnestness isn't a strategy, it’s a way of life". They paid some hundred grand for our asset protection attorneys; they think that it’s a kind of magic. 

But they're out of touch, and the latest changes to the classifiers prove it. They're squeamish about even the tightest college lists, the hyperspecialized kids who apply to just 300 schools, who have been doing applied quantum computing since they were born. Those kids, they say, are trouble: whose parents work at Amazon and gave them privileged cloud access with their first tablets. But the facts are that their portfolios are high yield, even if they are risky. 

The thing is, all things considered, my spread is average. It's not like I have to fill out my applications manually -- my college list is simply a matter of applying the right filters. I'm going to be applying to about 3000 applications, maybe 3500 if I need to flare out my safeties. And the distribution of schools that I'm applying for aren't the bottom of the barrel either. I have the UC-SCs in my reaches. I have a good number of state schools. I might even apply to Tufts itself, if only because my parents still think legacy counts for something. 

I just wish my parents had given me the option to choose. To live a life that wasn't perfectly imperfect. Take a vacation somewhere really nice, to spend money and not have to hide it in off-shore bank accounts. To forget about Earnestness for a second. The college application process is a game. No matter the quality we optimize for, it's always been a game, and I'm getting tired of playing it.

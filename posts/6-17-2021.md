Thursday, my second day working for City of Woodinville.

- I took home some buttercups, which are invasive and listed as weeds by the city:
- ![Buttercups and Dandelions - Highlands is Calling](https://highlandsiscalling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/buttercups-g.jpg)
- Also found white daisies by abandoned railroad
- Schedule is 6:30 am - 4 pm five days a week. It's physically exhausting, no creative time or energy left on weekdays. But I think I can comfortably keep improving this site and develop word.golf. Now there are just little changes to be made.

> Stormwater ponds need to balance removing water-hungry vegetation and providing pollinator habitat in flowers. Will talk to city person about this soon.

**blog todos**
- Must do: add images as clickable links to posts. Not very hard, I'll do it this weekend. 
- add threejs sometime
- adding content from the old site is more important. 

**word.golf todos**

- dynamic countdown between runs
- flesh out settings bar
- improve time-based features and profile screen
- other stuff I'll think about over weekend

Markdown is awesome! Update you all later.

Interesting tidbits from today

- Arctic ice is very different than Antarctic: maybe 10 feet thick vs hundreds/thousands
- The circulation of heat from the equator to the poles is what creates globe winds.
- Atlas Shrugged is also a good book
- Lime bikes are overrated. It charged me $7 for a two mile ride

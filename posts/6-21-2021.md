- [ ] (tomorrow) read through Placement 1 for CS0190 & start doing the problems.
- [ ] (tomorrow) pull content from old site here
- [ ] (wednesday) Make the UI for word.golf less highbrow: specifically, larger text and different font. Experiment with serif, yeah?
- [ ] (indeterminate) draft some blog posts with an eye for SEO 
- [ ] (indeterminate) implement categories for start/target words
- [ ] (indeterminate) color scheme

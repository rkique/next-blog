LOL no way am I doing any of the stuff I assigned myself from yesterday.

Some great progress made today for pollinator habitat preservation. Talked to Chris, who's the Public Works stormwater maintenance/coordinator person and he supports no removal of wildflowers e.g. daisies from the ponds. Now sending a more ambitious proposal to both Chris and Leah (City stormwater person) for active seeding of no-maintenance flowers (see [[pollinator proposal for stormwater ponds]]).

We've cut maybe 12 of the ponds already, so that's 24 out of 36 ponds with preserved wildflowers in Woodinville. Not a lot compared to agricultural/land use policy but it's definitely something. 

Now to build a little free library...

Site has been updated again. Looks nice, very crisp.

Time to work on golfing. Todo: smart start words, custom start words. and better UI. and racing. Racing will be hard, I can ignore it for a while.

Reading AVSI: Forests. It is very interesting, for example correlations can be found between populations of golden king-fishers (birds) and salmon in forests. The reason being the death of salmon in riverbeds recirculate nutrients and nitrogen to trees and enriched leaves create an abundance of insects upon which the birds feast.

First full work week. It is very hot outside. Learning to weld, will make a 90 joint tomorrow. Sadly cannot get arborist's license w/o 3 years experience. 

Will look for alternative licenses et cetera...

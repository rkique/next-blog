Deeply exhausted as usual after work today. 

Now that the blog is acceptably patched up I will start to work on golfing again. I need to revert the latest set of changes. And then add custom words. and then add racing.

There's a list of books that I want to read, pretty interested in *How We Learn* and also AVSI forests. But also I need to review math and continue with my CSCI 0190 course assignments. How will I ever have the energy to write like this?
And also to begin the process of choosing courses.

Got some logistical bits and pieces sorted out though yesterday which is good.

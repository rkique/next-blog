Today was another 4-4 day. Had a ton of caffeine, will probably crash later.

One big change for this summer is how long I spend on my laptop. I used to spend 8-10 hours a day in the weeks before I got a job and now I spend maybe 30 minutes tops, mostly writing these reflections and doing some very light reading.

It's a struggle to write anything coherent but I'm learning so much.

	- No such thing as pristine untouched forest 
	- the spread of conifers and flowering plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) occurred around the same time as the drift of continents into their current places
- FFF:essential function vs secondary function: trucks, energy, hydraulic pump
- highways and signs

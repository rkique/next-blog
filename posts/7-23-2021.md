There's a TON of work to do for this website but I see the path forward. I really like this idea of being able to see the last modified date, and passing things in through markdown to the final. It is also faster to send this type of update.

This is also more easily extensible. For plain html I was hitting the optimization level already. This format will always be a single command to deploy.

Green lights for golf.

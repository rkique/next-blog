## key facts
- We currently live in an interglacial period.
- The Pleistocene is the most recent geological period and goes up to 18,000 BP
- The spread of modern forests followed the retreat of the glaciers
- The spread of land plants was an integral moment in the history of life: not only biologically, but in its atmospheric and geological effects. Plants increase the rate of rock weathering, which draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to convert calcium & magnesium silicates to calcium & magnesium carbonates, and silicon dioxide (quartz).
- It is mainly the emergence of trees during the Carboniferous period, with huge root systems and higher biomass production rates, that caused this weathering
- From the Mid Devonian to the Carboniferous (385 -> 300 Mya) the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10. 

## early forests: coal did not come from familiar trees
- Most trees in the Devonian and Carboniferous were not like modern trees and were from a different species group (example shows Eospermatopteris, and the Cladoxylopsida group)
- One common species is the Lepidodendron, a giant glubmoss. Others include giant relatives of horsetail ferns. It is these forests, which formed dense and extensive lowland swamp forests, that put the carbon in carboniferous and gave us the immense coal deposits that powered the Industrial Revolution.
- The ancestor for all modern seed plants is the Progymnosperms, which includes Archaeopteris, a possible contender for first tree. Although they are the ancestors of *today's* seed plants, they reproduced by spores while the Cordaites and pteridosperms reproduced by seeds.

The death of these forests occurred during the Permian and Triassic (280-250 Mya). There was a gradual extinction of tree families, and the extent of forests declined greatly as a whole. There are no coal deposits from the early Jurassic, which is known as the coal gap. 

> *The early Triassic landscape was largely devoid of forests altogether, and even trees must have been scarce. This is the only time since the evolution of the first trees that forests were absent as one of Earth's biomes.*

## modern forests

Modern seed plants are either gymnosperms (conifers) or angiosperms (flowering plants). Their existence was made possible by the environmental changes wrought in the Permian (299-252 Mya) as land masses coalesced into Pangaea. This formation affected the climate in complex ways, but importantly it got warmer, drier, and CO2 concentrations rose. 

Conifers became widespread during the Triassic (252-201 Mya). Boreal conifer forests in Canada and northern Russia, the podocarp forests of New Zealand, the *Araucaria* (brushlike pointy tree) forests in Chile, and globally widespread temperate pine forests all trace their origin to the Triassic.

Flowering plants have their origin in the Cretaceous (125 Mya) but did not become widespread until the early Tertiary (66 Mya). 

*It's not clear why*.
Theories:
 - increased volcanism increased CO2 which created a much warmer environment which was good for angiosperms
 - Dinosaurs shifted from canopy browsing to munching on young conifer saplings, providing opportunities for angiosperms to establish (the evidence is unclear)
 - flowers evolved to attract insects and their success is tied to pollinator success (the evidence is unclear)
 - declining CO2 through the Cretaceous led to denser leaf venation and better absorption of CO2, allowing for higher growth rates. Higher transpiration rates humidified the atmosphere in rainforest areas and increased rain leading to a feedback loop. 

*From 60-50 Mya forests extended from pole to pole*. Then from 50 Mya to present the earth has been gradually cooling down. 

During the Eocene (56-34 Mya) Antarctica, SA, and Australasia began to break apart. 
During the Oligocene (30 Mya) this separation led to the formation of a circumpolar ocean circulation system *that isolated Antarctica from warm equatorial currents*. The forests went away there and contracted worldwide.

Mountains were created between 55 and 40 Mya further cooling the globe. In this drier and cooler climate, the spread of grasses was favored and grassland savannahs spread in tropical and subtropical regions. Grasses hold their growing tips at the base of leaf blads close to the soil which allows them to recover rapidly from fire and grazing.

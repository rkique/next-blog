- We currently live in an interglacial period.
- The Pleistocene is the most recent geological period and goes up to 18,000 BP
- The spread of modern forests followed the retreat of the glaciers

- The spread of land plants was an integral moment in the history of life: not only biologically, but in its atmospheric and geological effects. Plants increase the rate of rock weathering, which draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to convert calcium & magnesium silicates to calcium & magnesium carbonates, and silicon dioxide (quartz).
- It is mainly the emergence of trees during the Carboniferous period, with huge root systems and higher biomass production rates, that caused this weathering
- From the Mid Devonian to the Carboniferous (385 -> 300 MYA) the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10.

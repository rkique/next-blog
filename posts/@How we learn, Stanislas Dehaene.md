Revisiting off the cuff:

**The popular theory that babies lack object permanence is false. We are born with important starting assumptions, from evolutionary instincts, which feed their mental models of the world. We start out assuming the continued existence of objects, the coherency of solid objects, and intuition about probability. **

From the womb infants have been observed using the same brain structures for processing language as adults. These parse both low-level syntax and high level semantics in creating hiearchical mental models of languages.

The ability of newborns to learn about the world is extraordinary. In particular, they employ a variety of tools to learn language. it is this capacity for language (which Descartes writes about in Discourse on Method) wh the thing which distinguishes man from machine. 

tools: exclusivity, the idea that different words refer to different things.
Theory presented: the ability to consider negation (not a number) and quantification (not *any* number) allows for abstraction (infinite numbers)
We also track probability distributions of sounds in a language even when we don't understnad. native english learners will immediately recognize what does NOT belong to the language, like French /u/ 

Humans are much more efficient with data than artificial intelligence, as few-shot learners.  A critical period in child development is from 2-3 years when toddlers learn as many as *10-20* words a day.

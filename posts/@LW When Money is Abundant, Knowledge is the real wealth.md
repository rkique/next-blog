>When non-experts cannot distinguish true expertise from noise, money cannot buy expertise. Knowledge cannot be outsourced; we must understand things ourselves.

Connected to the idea: Only a philosopher understands what the work of a philosopher is like. Only an artist understands what the work of the artist is like... In learning.... your own image of what you are learning for & towards changes. Like a ... [[My Career as Homing Missile]] or something.


> In general, when one resource becomes abundant, other resources become bottlenecks. When money is abundant...

>King Louis XV of France was one of the richest and most powerful people in the world. He died of smallpox in 1774, the same year that a dairy farmer successfully immunized his wife and children with cowpox.

>After a certain point, wealth and power cease to be the taut constraints on one’s action space. They just don’t matter that much. Sure, giant yachts are great for social status, and our lizard-brains love politics. *The modern economy is happy to provide outlets for disposing of large amounts of wealth and power.* 

Expanding vs Filling

>But personally, I don’t care that much about giant yachts. I want a cure for aging. I want weekend trips to the moon. I want flying cars and an indestructible body and tiny genetically-engineered dragons. Money and power can’t efficiently buy that; the bottleneck is knowledge.

>At "comparatively low money levels" in the low hundreds of thousands (haha), if you know how to create a cure for cancer you could obtain the resources to do so. 

Beyond that level, more money just means more tries at "spraying and praying", which is inefficient due to the curse of large dimensionality--> although I don't think this is true. If you have a general direction of interest --> like stem cells, resources increase chances linearly. Things almost never work first try as well.

What is really important, according to the author, is knowledge.
mental modeling -->

I really do not trust that molecular modeling involves testing out random molecules at any success rate less than painstakingly determined to be optimal, but OK data scientist.

# investments in knowledge

> Once I understand the internal details of how e.g. capacitors work, I can apply that knowledge to understand not only electronic circuits, but also charged biological membranes. When I understand the math of microeconomics, I can apply it to optimization problems in AI. When I understand shocks and rarefactions in nonlinear PDEs, I can see them in action at the beach or in traffic. And the “core” topics -

(Possible cringe)

calculus
linear algebra
differential equations
big-O analysis
Bayesian probability
optimization
dynamical systems

>--- can be applied all over. General-purpose models are a capital investment in knowledge.

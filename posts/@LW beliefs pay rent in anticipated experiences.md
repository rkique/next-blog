It is even better to ask: what experience must not happen to you? Do you believe that Élan vital explains the mysterious aliveness of living beings? Then what does this belief not allow to happen—what would definitely falsify this belief?

A null answer means that your belief does not constrain experience; it permits anything to happen to you. It floats. Floating beliefs are not useful.

When you argue a seemingly factual question, always keep in mind which difference of anticipation you are arguing about. If you can’t find the difference of anticipation, you’re probably arguing about labels in your belief network—or even worse, floating beliefs, barnacles on your network. If you don’t know what experiences are implied by Wulky Wilkinsens writing being retropositional, you can go on arguing forever.

What would prove me wrong about drug pricing?
The existence of other countries/times where research activity was approximately equivalent and not lowered due to lower drug prices.

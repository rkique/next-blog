## Moloch

==Prisoner's Dilemma, Tragedy of Commons (core non-libertarian argument), Malthusian Trap (eliminating "culture" margins), Capitalism, the *Two Income Trap* in relation to housing, Agriculture (Jared Diamond's "worst mistake in human history"), Arms Races (particularly with regard to national military budget), ==

The individuals are acting rationally, but suffer without coordination!

Competition sacrificing human value (libertarian) and inefficiency being useless (monarchy). Focuses very heavily on the idea of coordination as a value generator.
 
 >Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power. As long as the offer’s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.

### Thoughts
This would have been a really cool article had I not heard of game theory, or underwent the relentless optimization abuse of LessWrong for quite a prolonged period of time. As it stands, it is pretty interesting and historically coincidental that so much of what applies to Moloch also applies to human ... competition? 
## beliefs pay rent in anticipated experiences

It is even better to ask: what experience must not happen to you? Do you believe that Élan vital explains the mysterious aliveness of living beings? Then what does this belief not allow to happen—what would definitely falsify this belief?

A null answer means that your belief does not constrain experience; it permits anything to happen to you. It floats. Floating beliefs are not useful.

When you argue a seemingly factual question, always keep in mind which difference of anticipation you are arguing about. If you can’t find the difference of anticipation, you’re probably arguing about labels in your belief network—or even worse, floating beliefs, barnacles on your network. If you don’t know what experiences are implied by Wulky Wilkinsens writing being retropositional, you can go on arguing forever.

What would prove me wrong about drug pricing?
The existence of other countries/times where research activity was approximately equivalent and not lowered due to lower drug prices.

	
	
## blue and green

people living underground, divided into Blue and Green factions, discover that the sky is blue. Responses range from righteous ecstasy to nihilism to everything-is-evil to resignation to the truth, to wonder at 

>the blue _sky_, the white _clouds_, the vast unknown _outside_, full of places and things (and people?) that no Undergrounder had ever seen. “Oh, so _that’s_what color it is,” Ferris said, and went exploring.

refers to religion, politics, religious differneces?

I have had this experience several times in my life; I come across clear enough evidence that settles for me an issue I had seen long disputed. At that point my choice is to either go back and try to persuade disputants, or to continue on to explore the new issues that this settlement raises. As Eliezer implicitly advises, after a short detour to tell a few disputants, I have usually chosen this second route. This is one explanation for the existence of settled but still disputed issues; people who learn the answer leave the conversation.

## When Money is Abundant, Knowledge is the real wealth
...My first introduction to LW

>When non-experts cannot distinguish true expertise from noise, money cannot buy expertise. Knowledge cannot be outsourced; we must understand things ourselves.

Connected to the idea: Only a philosopher understands what the work of a philosopher is like. Only an artist understands what the work of the artist is like... In learning.... your own image of what you are learning for & towards changes. Like a ... [[My Career as Homing Missile]] or something.


> In general, when one resource becomes abundant, other resources become bottlenecks. When money is abundant...

>King Louis XV of France was one of the richest and most powerful people in the world. He died of smallpox in 1774, the same year that a dairy farmer successfully immunized his wife and children with cowpox.

>After a certain point, wealth and power cease to be the taut constraints on one’s action space. They just don’t matter that much. Sure, giant yachts are great for social status, and our lizard-brains love politics. *The modern economy is happy to provide outlets for disposing of large amounts of wealth and power.* 

Expanding vs Filling

>But personally, I don’t care that much about giant yachts. I want a cure for aging. I want weekend trips to the moon. I want flying cars and an indestructible body and tiny genetically-engineered dragons. Money and power can’t efficiently buy that; the bottleneck is knowledge.

>At "comparatively low money levels" in the low hundreds of thousands (haha), if you know how to create a cure for cancer you could obtain the resources to do so. 

Beyond that level, more money just means more tries at "spraying and praying", which is inefficient due to the curse of large dimensionality--> although I don't think this is true. If you have a general direction of interest --> like stem cells, resources increase chances linearly. Things almost never work first try as well.

What is really important, according to the author, is knowledge.
mental modeling -->

I really do not trust that molecular modeling involves testing out random molecules at any success rate less than painstakingly determined to be optimal, but OK data scientist.

### investments in knowledge

> Once I understand the internal details of how e.g. capacitors work, I can apply that knowledge to understand not only electronic circuits, but also charged biological membranes. When I understand the math of microeconomics, I can apply it to optimization problems in AI. When I understand shocks and rarefactions in nonlinear PDEs, I can see them in action at the beach or in traffic. And the “core” topics -

calculus
linear algebra
differential equations
big-O analysis
Bayesian probability
optimization
dynamical systems

>--- can be applied all over. General-purpose models are a capital investment in knowledge.


## Privacy
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qmXqHKpgRfg83Nif9/how-to-ignore-your-emotions-while-also-thinking-you-re


Crude rational approaches to morality are usually wrong due to [[culture of craft]]. Privacy is sometimes good, expressing your feelings is sometimes good. Conformity is sometimes good. 


Privacy creates a space in which unexpected or unsightly things can be expressed. It’s like a cocoon for thoughts and feelings. A lot of ugly transformational work can take place there that simply couldn’t occur in an open environment (the bug literally dissolves!). The gnarly thoughts and feelings need to do their work undisturbed by any self-consciousness or fear of judgment, just like caterpillars need a tight encasement where the wind won’t scatter their components as they reassemble into butterflies.


## Illusion of Transparency

Although I am smart and friendly, people don't listen to me 
<=> 
Although they are smart and friendly, they are hard to understand.


The illusion of transparency is a tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others.

 ==Whatever the hill, odds are, it’s not the one you want to die on.==
 
There is a paradox at the heart of mediocrity studies: excellence is not actually exceptional. If you see an excellent behavior or thing, it’s likely to be a middling instance at its _level._

blah blah blah optimization is the new dunning kruger

Mediocritizers likes to live on slopes rather than tops or bottoms. The reason is subtle: on a slope, there is _always_ a way to tell directions apart. The environment is different in different directions. It is _anisotropic_. Mediocritization is an environmental anisotropy maintaining process (not a satisficing process as naive optimizers tend to assume).

Anisotropy is information in disguise. Optimizers get stuck at the bottoms of valleys or tops of hills because the world is locally flat. No direction is any different from any other. There are no meaningful decisions to make relative to the external world because it is the same in all directions, or _isotropic_...

The effective psychological transaction is: “I will pretend to believe your explanations for your performance gap if you pretend to accept my posture of power.”

"optimization theater":Capability masking is a big part of what I call optimization theater. Our world runs on transactions that are ceremonially based on one party (usually the stronger one) demanding optimal performance from another and the other promising that performance. Job candidates promise to “do their best”. Sales people tell you they’re giving you the best deal possible. Politicians promise to work all out to fulfill campaign promises. Parents pretend in playing with children that they’re trying hard. Children promise to clean their rooms.

Instead of a fragile pattern of constantly overreaching and failing, driven by clueless true believers in false consciousness myths, we have a pattern of constantly underpromising, and _sometimes_ overdelivering, by more self-aware actors.

==The evolution of a society is an arms race between the fragile evolution of false consciousness myths and the robust evolution of mutually assured mediocrity equilibria. That’s how you slouch towards utopia.==

This sounds like MAYA

A very compact way to explain mediocrity philosophy is this: non-attachment to finite games (5 words). Unfortunately those who can’t process the Carse reference will almost certainly misunderstand it.

The reference is to finite and infinite games [in the sense of James Carse](https://amzn.to/2keWfuE). A finite game is when you play to win. An infinite game is when you play to continue the game. 
> Non-attachment to a finite game means being free to reject both winning and losing. This generally happens when you are able to see and choose ways to keep the infinite game going that are orthogonal to the win/loss logic of a particular finite game. **This posture can look like betrayal, cowardice, or choking to those who are attached to a particular finite game, which is why the connotations of mediocrity are invariably negative for finite gamers.**

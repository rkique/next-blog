We already use markets to compare our relative confidence in worldly currencies, and we can apply the same mechanism to crowdsource a perpetual audit of epistemic currencies (news sites).

>An epistemic currency market would establish a direct relationship between prominence and scrutiny, illuminating the best ROI on your trust. For example, if market participants audit a publisher and find it has no truth in its reserves, then it is epistemically insolvent, and demand for its epistemic reserve note goes down (i.e., people exchange its articles less).

Lmaooooo. Post-factual "epistemic economy" this is very interesting

## The metaphor of facts vs metaphor of risk-management
[[Wittgenstein#wittgenstein's revenge]]

>Given Facts imply a moral obligation to believe, every fact is a micro-Bible, demanding its own micro-crusade to carry it forth to trample the heretics.

>“To be able to destroy with good conscience, to be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior ‘righteous indignation’ — this is the height of psychological luxury, the most delicious of moral treats.” Aldous Huxley

facts | risk-management
------|----------------
Anti-science: implies certainty and permanence| pro-science: implies uncertainty is fundamental
False binary | quantified nuance
moral obligation | practical necessity
"facts" notion empowers cranks | greed makes us desire truth
anti-free speech | pro-free speech

Something something credulity is an asymmetric bet (?). 
I agree with this: Credulity accounts for systemic ideological risk.

# The race to the bottom
==Prisoner's Dilemma, Tragedy of Commons (core non-libertarian argument), Malthusian Trap (eliminating "culture" margins), Capitalism, the *Two Income Trap* in relation to housing, Agriculture (Jared Diamond's "worst mistake in human history"), Arms Races (particularly with regard to national military budget), ==

The individuals are acting rationally, but suffer without coordination!

Competition sacrificing human value (libertarian) and inefficiency being useless (monarchy). Focuses very heavily on the idea of coordination as a value generator.
 
 >Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I can grant you power. As long as the offerâ€™s open, it will be irresistible. So we need to close the offer. Only another god can kill Moloch. We have one on our side, but he needs our help. We should give it to him.

This would have been a really cool article had I not heard of game theory, or underwent the relentless optimization abuse of LessWrong for quite a prolonged period of time. As it stands, it is pretty interesting and historically coincidental that so much of what applies to Moloch also applies to human ... competition?

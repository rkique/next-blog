[[lw]] Map and Territory

>If once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up covering the territory exactly \[...\] this fable has now come full circle for us, and possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacrum \[...\] It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself.

Self-fulfilling prophecies
>Referring to "On Exactitude in Science", he argued that just as for contemporary society the simulated copy had superseded the original object, so, too, the map had come to precede the geographic territory

>the image of war preceded real war. War comes not when it is made by sovereign against sovereign (not when killing for attritive and strategic neutralisation purposes is authorised; nor even, properly spoken, when shots are fired); rather, war comes when society is generally convinced that it is coming.

Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map

Korzybski: "the map is not the territory" *Science and Sanity*
>A map _is not_ the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a _similar structure_ to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.

simulation and simulacra is what I expected leftists to care about: the suffocation of reality in late capitalism by kitsch [[@The Eternal Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera]]/ simulacrum. 

see grubhub ad for example of the hyperreal 

First order, associated with the premodern period, where representation is clearly an artificial placemarker for the real item. The uniqueness of objects and situations marks them as irreproducibly real and signification obviously gropes towards this reality.

Second order, associated with the modernity of the Industrial Revolution, where distinctions between representation and reality break down due to the proliferation of mass-reproducible copies of items, turning them into commodities. The commodity's ability to imitate reality threatens to replace the authority of the original version, because the copy is just as "real" as its prototype.

Third order, associated with the postmodernity of Late Capitalism, where the simulacrum precedes the original and the distinction between reality and representation vanishes. There is only the simulation, and originality becomes a totally meaningless concept.[9]

Distinction between simulation -- which requires producing true "symptoms" -- and merely pretending something.

But what becomes of the divinity when it reveals itself in icons, when it is multiplied in simulacra? Does it remain the supreme power that is simply incarnated in images as a visible theology? Or does it volatilize itself in the simulacra that, alone, deploy their power and pomp of fascination - the visible machinery of icons substituted for the pure and intelligible Idea of God

1. We cannot depict god in painting. This is because when the appearance of simulacra (physical forms of divinity) shows that deep down God never existed, that only the simulacrum ever existed, even that God himself was never anything but his own simulacrum - from this came their urge to destroy the images

leftists say simulacra and simulation radicalized them and then don't want to discuss media aesthetics 


## observer bias
>Ethnology brushed up against its paradoxical death in 1971, the day when the Philippine government decided to return the few dozen Tasaday who had just been discovered in the depths of the jungle, where they had lived for eight centuries without any contact with the rest of the species, to their primitive state, out of the reach of colonizers, tourists, and ethnologists. This at the suggestion of the anthropologists themselves, who were seeing the indigenous people disintegrate immediately upon contact, like mummies in the open air.

> In order for ethnology to live, its object must die; by dying, the object takes its revenge for being "discovered" and with its death defies the science that wants to grasp it.

It is not a question of sacrifice (science never sacrifices itself, it is always murderous), but of the simulated sacrifice of its object in order to save its reality principle.

- preserving the reality principle that some "untouched culture" exists.

>The Indian thus returned to the ghetto, in the glass coffin of the virgin forest, again becomes the model of simulation of all the possible Indians from before ethnology. This model thus grants itself the luxury to incarnate itself beyond itself in the "brute" reality of these Indians it has entirely reinvented - Savages who are indebted to ethnology for still being Savages: what a turn of events, what a triumph for this science that seemed dedicated to their destruction!

### museum principles

>Of course, these savages are posthumous: frozen, cryogenized, sterilized, protected to death, they have become referential simulacra, and science itself has become pure simulation. The same holds true at Cruesot, at the level of the "open" museum where one museumified in situ, as "historical" witnesses of their period, entire working-class neighborhoods, living metallurgic zones, an entire culture, men, women, and children included - gestures, languages, customs fossilized alive as in a snapshot. 

==The museum, instead of being circumscribed as a geometric site, is everywhere now, like a dimension of life.==

some myth of unaffected racial relation:

> Thus ethnology, rather than circumscribing itself as an objective science, will today, liberated from its object, be applied to all living things and make itself invisible, like an omnipresent fourth dimension, that of the simulacrum. We are all Tasadays, 
	> Indians who have again become what they were: simulacral Indians who at last proclaim the universal truth of ethnology.

We have all become living specimens in the spectral light of ethnology, or of antiethnology, which is nothing but the pure form of triumphal ethnology, under the sign of dead differences, and of the resurrection of differences. It is thus very naive to look for ethnology in the Savages or in some Third World - it is here, everywhere, in the metropolises, in the White community, in a world completely cataloged and analyzed, then artificially resurrected under the auspices of the real, in a world of simulation, of the hallucination of truth, of the blackmail of the real, of the murder of every symbolic form and of its hysterical, historical retrospection - a murder of which the Savages, noblesse oblige, were the first victims, but that for a long time has extended to all Western societies.

As ethnology collapses in its classical institution, it survives in an antiethnology whose task it is to reinject the difference fiction, the Savage fiction everywhere, to conceal that it is this world, ours, which has again become savage in its way, that is to say, which is devastated by difference and by death.

Lascaux caves --> the duplication suffices to render both the copy and original artificial.

Preserve the mummy in the museum!
> what guarantees that accumulation has meaning

Our entire linear and accumulative culture collapses if we cannot stockpile the past in plain view. The case of the mummy has interesting parallels to Francis Fukayama's end of history. Through exposure to the inevitable [[neoliberal]] order of the world, objects of the past lose their religious / spiritual significance. They become no more than a "curio".

>Because mummies don't rot from worms: they die from being transplanted from a slow order of the symbolic, master over putrefaction and death, to an order of history, science, and museums, our order, which no longer masters anything

Taking the mummy, the lascaux caves, and indian tribes as examples, Baudrillard claims:
> Everywhere we live in a universe strangely similar to the original - things are doubled by their own scenario. But this doubling does not signify, as it did traditionally (in the industrial revolution), the imminence of their death. They are already purged of their death, and better than when they were alive; more cheerful, more authentic, in the light of their model, like the faces in funeral homes. (i.e. it is a fake platonic ideal of "native americans", concealing the nonexistence of truth).

## baudrillard takes on disneyland

No, it's the rollercoasters!
> Disneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders of simulacra. It is first of all a play of illusions and phantasms: the Pirates, the Frontier, the Future World, etc. This imaginary world is supposed to ensure the success of the operation. But what attracts the crowds the most is without a doubt the social microcosm, the religious, miniaturized pleasure of real America, of its constraints and joys.

Goes beyond mere cynicism of ideological analysis 
>All its values are exalted by the miniature and the comic strip. Embalmed and pacified. Whence the possibility of an ideological analysis of Disneyland (L. Marin did it very well in Utopiques, jeux d'espace [Utopias, play of space]): digest of the American way of life, panegyric of American values, idealized transposition of a contradictory reality. Certainly.

to find the simulation of the third order: disneyland exists in order to hide that it is the real country (? what does this mean). 

Connection: pretending to pretend that you believe a company will do well

>disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real ... the America that surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the order of simulation. 
>"It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology) but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of ==saving the reality principle.==""

Elaborating:

> This world wants to be childish in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that true childishness is everywhere - that it is that of the adults themselves who come here to act the child in order to foster illusions as to their real childishness.

This is incredibly wrong.

> Enchanted Village, Magic Mountain, Marine World: Los Angeles is surrounded by these imaginary stations that feed reality, the energy of the real to a city whose mystery is precisely that of no longer being anything but a network of incessant, unreal circulation - a city of incredible proportions but without space, without dimension. As much as electrical and atomic power stations, as much as cinema studios, this city, _which is no longer anything but an immense scenario and a perpetual pan shot_, needs this old imaginary like a sympathetic nervous system made up of childhood signals and faked phantasms.

Essentially: Disneyland is a place to keep dreams alive

On simulated penury or surplus pain:

> Marshall Sahlins's idea that it is the economy of the market, and not of nature at all, that secretes penury, is verified, but at a secondary level: here, in the sophisticated confines of a triumphal market economy is reinvented a penury/sign, a penury/simulacrum, a simulated behavior of the underdeveloped (including the adoption of Marxist tenets) that, in the guise of ecology, of energy crises and the critique of capital, adds a final esoteric aureole to the triumph of an esoteric culture. Nevertheless, maybe a mental catastrophe, a mental implosion and involution without precedent lies in wait for a system of this kind, whose visible signs would be those of this strange obesity, or the incredible coexistence of the most bizarre theories and practices, which correspond to the improbable coalition of luxury, heaven, and money, to the improbable luxurious materialization of life and to undiscoverable contradictions.

On watergate:
 > The denunciation of scandal is always an homage to the law. 
 > And Watergate in particular succeeded in imposing the idea that Watergate was a scandal - in this sense it was a prodigious operation of intoxication. A large dose of political morality reinjected on a world scale. One could say along with Bourdieu: "The essence of every relation of force is to dissimulate itself as such and to acquire all its force only because it dissimulates itself as such,"
 
the renewed morality of watergate enables capitalism to function:
> capital, immoral and without scruples, can only function behind a moral superstructure, and whoever revives this public morality (through indignation, denunciation, etc.) works spontaneously for the order of capital.

Baudrillard does not believe in consistent moral systems:
> All that capital asks of us is to receive it as rational or to combat it in the name of rationality, to receive it as moral or to combat it in the name of morality. Because these are the same, which can be thought of in another way: formerly one worked to dissimulate scandal - today one works to conceal that there is none.

These moral systems by simply entertaining capitalism give legitimacy to an extremely immoral enterprise:
>this dissimulation masking a strengthening of morality, of a moral panic as one approaches the primitive (mise en) sc�ne of capital: its instantaneous cruelty, its incomprehensible ferocity, its fundamental immorality - that is what is scandalous, unacceptable to the system of moral and economic equivalence that is the axiom of leftist thought, from the theories of the Enlightenment up to Communism

Facts are irrelevant when models come first in the LOGIC of SIMULATION:
> characterized by a precession of the model, of all the models based on the merest fact - the models come first, their circulation, orbital like that of the bomb, constitutes the genuine magnetic field of the event. The facts no longer have a specific trajectory, they are born at the intersection of models, a single fact can be engendered by all the models at once. This anticipation, this precession, this short circuit, this confusion of the fact with its model (no more divergence of meaning, no more dialectical polarity, no more negative electricity, implosion of antagonistic poles), is what allows each time for all possible interpretations, even the most contradictory - all true, in the sense that their truth is to be exchanged, in the image of the models from which they derive, in a generalized cycle.

Here is where postmodernists get into their most controversial position. Baudrillard states that discourse is meaningless:
>All of this is simultaneously true. It is the secret of a discourse that is no longer simply ambiguous, as political discourses can be, but that conveys the impossibility of a determined position of power, the impossibility of a determined discursive position. And this logic is neither that of one party nor of another. It traverses all discourses without them wanting it to.

Cringe:

	If one envisions the entire cycle of any act or event in a system where linear continuity and dialectical polarity no longer exist, in a field unhinged by simulation, all determination evaporates, every act is terminated at the end of the cycle having benefited everyone and having been scattered in all directions.

	Who will unravel this imbroglio? The Gordian knot can at least be cut. The M�bius strip, if one divides it, results in a supplementary spiral without the reversibility of surfaces being resolved (here the reversible continuity of hypotheses)
	
	Conjunction of the system and of its extreme alternative like the two sides of a curved mirror, a "vicious" curvature of a political space that is henceforth magnetized, circularized, reversibilized from the right to the left, a torsion that is like that of the evil spirit of commutation, the whole system, the infinity of capital folded back on its own surface: transfinite
	
Baudrillard uses the description "mobius & circular" to describe two opposing ideas which exchange signifiers and scenarios over time. 
For example: desire and repression, sex and work, history and nature ...

Baudrillard has this idea of negative space:

> It is always a question of proving the real through the imaginary, proving truth through scandal, proving the law through transgression, proving work through striking, proving the system through crisis, and capital through revolution, as it is elsewhere (the Tasaday) of proving ethnology through the dispossession of its object - without taking into account: the proof of theater through antitheater; the proof of art through antiart; the proof of pedagogy through antipedagogy; the proof of psychiatry through antipsychiatry, etc.

==The simulation of death is an attempt to escape real death==
(of an institution). Power can stage its own murder to rediscover a glimmer of existence and legitimacy. This is somewhat akin to a martyrdom, or [[veblen good]]. For example, the Kennedys were murdered because they still had a political dimension

This is akin to [[Goodhart's Law]] manipulation: 

>For example: it would be interesting to see whether the repressive apparatus would not react more violently to a simulated holdup than to a real holdup. Because the latter does nothing but disturb the order of things, the right to property, whereas the former attacks the reality principle itself. Transgression and violence are less serious because they only contest the distribution of the real. Simulation is infinitely more dangerous because it always leaves open to supposition that, above and beyond its object, law and order themselves might be nothing but simulation.

Attacking the reality principle is a simulation which shows that repressive apparatus chooses the wrong set of symptoms to react against, i.e. being black.

### true simulation is impossible
 Organize a fake holdup. 
 >Verify that your weapons are harmless, and take the most trustworthy hostage, so that no human life will be in danger (or one lapses into the criminal). Demand a ransom, and make it so that the operation creates as much commotion as possible - in short, remain close to the "truth," in order to test the reaction of the apparatus to a perfect simulacrum. You won't be able to do it: the network of artificial signs will become inextricably mixed up with real elements (a policeman will really fire on sight; a client of the bank will faint and die of a heart attack; one will actually pay you the phony ransom), in short, you will immediately find yourself once again, without wishing it, in the real, one of whose functions is precisely to devour any attempt at simulation, to reduce everything to the real - that is, to the established order itself, well before institutions and justice come into play.

This "repressive apparatus" cannot see and conceive of anything but the real. It is impossible to isolate this order, because it cannot function except in terms of the real. Because your simulation is seen as parody, it renders submission and transgression equivalent. "Simulation is the third order, beyond true and false ... beyond rational distinctions upon which the whole of social and power depend." It challenges the reality principle of order, in which it operates.

 crime becomes simulated crime:

> This is how all the holdups, airplane hijackings, etc. are now in some sense simulation holdups in that they are already inscribed in the decoding and orchestration rituals of the media, anticipated in their presentation and their possible consequences. In short, where they function as a group of signs dedicated exclusively to their recurrence as signs, and no longer at all to their "real" end.

Power needs subjects who believe in the real:

> power itself ends by being dismantled in this space and becoming a simulation of power (disconnected from its ends and its objectives, and dedicated to the effects of power and mass simulation).

Baudrillard now changes tack and says that hyperreality and simulation can turn against power. In the past, when the threat came at power from the real, "power played at deterrence and simulation, disintegrating all the contradictions by dint of producing equivalent signs". Today, when the threat to power is from simulation (being dissolved in the play of signs), power must play at the real, manufacturing artificial social, economic, and political stakes. 

Overproduction bad:
> What every society looks for in continuing to produce, and to overproduce, is to restore the real that escapes it. That is why today this "material" production is that of the hyperreal itself. It retains all the features, the whole discourse of traditional production, but it is no longer anything but its scaled-down refraction (thus hyper-realists fix a real from which all meaning and charm, all depth and energy of representation have vanished in a hallucinatory resemblance).

Power creates obsession with power, which is expressed as fascism:

> And in the end the game of power becomes nothing but the critical obsession with power - obsession with its death, obsession with its survival, which increases as it disappears. When it has totally disappeared, we will logically be under the total hallucination of power - a haunting memory that is already in evidence everywhere, expressing at once the compulsion to get rid of it (no one wants it anymore, everyone unloads it on everyone else) and the panicked nostalgia over its loss. The melancholy of societies without power: this has already stirred up fascism, that overdose of a strong referential in a society that cannot terminate its mourning.

RACIST
>curiously, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, all have this simian mug, the monkeys of power.

### figureheads and death

In the past, the literal death of a figurehead ensures the mythic dimension of their existence.

>Death is never an absolute criterion, but in this case it is significant: the era of James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and the Kennedys, of those who really died simply because they had a mythic dimension that implies death (not for romantic reasons, but because of the fundamental principle of reversal and exchange) 

This era is long gone.

NOW, it is the era of murder by simulation, of the generalized aesthetic of simulation: the "allegorical resurrection of death which is only there to sanction the institution of power".
 
In accordance with this  "principle of reversal and- exchange", baudrillard says something interesting:

> the function of bringing death to, or the prophecy, etc., against power has always been fulfilled, from primitive societies to the present, by demented people, crazy people, or neurotics, who nonetheless carry out a social function as fundamental as that of presidents.

What does this even mean, is it just politician hatred? [[denial of death|death drive]]

> Nixon has nevertheless arrived at the goal of which all power dreams: to be taken seriously enough, to constitute a mortal enough danger to the group to be one day relieved of his duties, denounced, and liquidated.

### On the American TV verite experiment

> More interesting is the illusion of filming the Louds as if TV weren't there. The producer's triumph was to say: "They lived as if we were not there." An absurd, paradoxical formula - neither true nor false: Utopian. The "as if we were not there" being equal to "as if you were there." It is this Utopia, this paradox that fascinated the twenty million viewers, much more than did the "perverse" pleasure of violating someone's privacy. In the "verite" experience it

>this family was already hyperreal by the very nature of its selection: a typical ideal American family, California home, three garages, five children, assured social and professional status, decorative housewife, upper-middle-class standing. In a way it is this statistical perfection that dooms it to death. Ideal heroine of the American way of life, it is, as in ancient sacrifices, chosen in order to be glorified and to die beneath the flames of the medium, a modern fatum. Because heavenly fire no longer falls on corrupted cities, it is the camera lens that, like a laser, comes to pierce lived reality in order to put it to death. "The Louds: simply a family who agreed to deliver themselves into the hands of television, and to die by it," the director will say. Thus it is a question of a sacrificial process, of a sacrificial spectacle offered to twenty million Americans. The liturgical drama of a mass society.

The Louds are a sacrificial family, put to death by the camera lens, which selects an ideal specimen exemplifying the American way of life.

"It is TV that is true, TV that renders true": Baudrillard cites modern "manipulative truths" akin to the "test which sounds out and interrogates", a laser that "touches and pierces", computer cards, genetic codes, and biological cells. 

The real is confused with the model in hyperreal sociality. Our own involvement in society makes us complicit: social relations are no longer of persuasion but one of deterrence: Such is the last stage of the social relation, ours, which is no longer one of persuasion (the classical age of propaganda, of ideology, of publicity, etc.) but one of deterrence: "YOU are information, you are the social, you are the event, you are involved, you have the word, etc."

### end of perspective and the spectacle

"We are witnessing the end of perspectival and panoptic space".

Television is no longer a spectacular medium (as we saw in the case of the Louds). We are no longer in the society of the spectacle of which the situationists spoke. Instead: 

>the medium itself is no longer identifiable as such, and the confusion of the medium and the message is the first great formula of this new era. There is no longer a medium in the literal sense: it is now intangible, diffused, and diffracted in the real, and one can no longer even say that the medium is altered by it.

Because the medium is inextricable from reality, we face danger of its infiltration: 

> we are all Louds doomed not to invasion, to pressure, to violence and blackmail by the media and the models, but to their induction, to their infiltration, to their illegible violence.

What the fuck does this mean
The medium translates reality to the hypereal?
> One must think instead of the media as if they were, in outer orbit, a kind of genetic code that directs the mutation of the real into the hyperreal, just as the other micromolecular code controls the passage from a representative sphere of meaning to the genetic one of the programmed signal. 

ahahhcssha

> Now, one must conceive of TV along the lines of DNA as an effect in which the opposing poles of determination vanish, according to a nuclear contraction, retraction, of the old polar schema that always maintained a minimal distance between cause and effect, between subject and object: precisely the distance of meaning, the gap, the difference, the smallest possible gap (PPEP!), 8 irreducible under pain of reabsorption into an aleatory and indeterminate process whose discourse can no longer account for it, because it is itself a determined order. It is this gap that vanishes in the process of genetic coding, in which indeterminacy is not so much a question of molecular randomness ans of the abolition, pure and simple, of the relation. In the process of molecular control, which "goes" from the DNA nucleus to the "substance" that it "informs," there is no longer the traversal of an effect, of an energy, of a determination, of a message. 
> "Order, signal, impulse, message": all of these attempt to render the thing [transcription, central dogma?] intelligible to us, but by analogy, retranscribing in terms of inscription, of a vector, of decoding, a dimension of which we know nothing - it is no longer even a "dimension," or perhaps it is the fourth (which is denned, however, in Einsteinian relativity by the absorption of the distinct poles of space and time). 

disappointing man
> In fact, this whole process can only be understood in its negative form: nothing separates one pole from another anymore, the beginning from the end; there is a kind of contraction of one over the other, a fantastic telescoping, a collapse of the two traditional poles into each other: implosion - an absorption of the radiating mode of causality, of the differential mode of determination, with its positive and negative charge - an implosion of meaning. That is where simulation begins.

The nuclear threat created a deterrence which had no subject: it encapsulated the entirety of the world. It has the pretext of a maximal, "objective," threat: total world destruction.

> Deterrence precludes war - the archaic violence of expanding systems. Deterrence itself is the neutral, implosive violence of metastable systems or systems in involution. There is no longer a subject of deterrence, nor an adversary nor a strategy - it is a planetary structure of the annihilation of stakes.

Nice: ==The balance of terror is the terror of balance.==

The floating "money of destruction" (atomic weaponry) doesn't reference real destruction in the same way that floating capital does reference production. The progressive satellization of the whole planet through this hypermodel of security.

So how is satellization connected to the atomic age? is surveillance inherently tied to the development of nuclear power?

Brinksmanship: You are not facing a person, you are facing a machine. 

story idea: there's this human resources company which employs a division of people solely to come up with eccentric icebreaker questions/ warmups which become used by hundreds of millions of people. multinational companies realize that they can surreptitiously advertise with subliminal messsaging within these questions and begin to compete for the loyalty of these copywriters.


The system of deterrence / surveillance mechanism makes all conflict simulacra:

> A gigantic involution that makes every conflict, every finality, every confrontation contract in proportion to this blackmail that interrupts, neutralizes, freezes them all. No longer can any revolt, any story be deployed according to its own logic because it risks annihilation. No strategy is possible any longer, and escalation is only a puerile game given over to the military. The political stake is dead, only simulacra of conflicts and carefully circumscribed stakes remain.

The exaltation of the crowds was not a response to the event of landing on the moon or of sending a man into space (this would be, rather, the fulfillment of an earlier dream), rather, we are dumbfounded by the perfection of the programming and the technical manipulation, by the immanent wonder of the programmed unfolding of events. Fascination with the maximal norm and the mastery of probability.

It is easier to imagine the "perverse imaginary" of law (transgression) and order (violence). On the other hand, the norm :
>fixes, fascinates, stupefies, and makes every imaginary involute. One no longer fantasizes about the minutiae of a program. Just watching it produces vertigo. The vertigo of a world without flaws.

### satellization

>Resist the evidence: in satellization, he who is satellized is not who one might think. Through the orbital inscription of a spatial object, it is the planet earth that becomes a satellite, it is the terrestrial principle of reality that becomes eccentric, hyperreal

The existence of orbital satellites(the physical systems of control) and the biological genetic code systems of control are two fundamental codes of deterrence: every principle of meaning is absorbed, every deployment of the real is impossible.

>Through the orbital instantiation of a system of control like peaceful coexistence, all the terrestrial microsystems are satellized and lose their autonomy. All energy, all events are absorbed by this eccentric gravitation, everything condenses and implodes toward the only micromodel of control (the orbital satellite), as conversely, in the other, biological, dimension, everything converges and implodes on the molecular micromodel of the genetic code. Between the two, in this forking of the nuclear and the genetic, in the simultaneous assumption of the two fundamental codes of deterrence, every principle of meaning is absorbed, every deployment of the real is impossible.

### vietnam war

Why did this American defeat (the largest reversal in the history of the USA) have no internal repercussions in America? If it had really signified the failure of the planetary strategy of the United States, it would necessarily have completely disrupted its internal balance and the American political system. Nothing of the sort occurred.

The deradicalization of the "radical alternative" was the US's real victory in Vietnam: 
> the transition from a radical alternative to political alternation in a system now essentially regulated (the normalization of Peking - Washington relations): this was what was at stake in the war in Vietnam, and in this sense, the USA pulled out of Vietnam but won the war.

It was in reality a war against savage cultures:
> As soon as the Vietnamese had proved that they were no longer the carriers of an unpredictable subversion, one could let them take over. That theirs is a Communist order is not serious in the end: it had proved itself, it could be trusted. It is even more effective than capitalism in the liquidation of "savage" and archaic precapitalist structures.

"Same scenario in the algeria war".  I wonder if the modern catchphrase of  "stability" is what Baudrillard refers to here.

The objective of war is never for the survival of a particular way of life (at least for Americans): the two adversaries (capitalist and communist) are fundamentally working together to abolish something else:

>behind the armed violence, the murderous antagonism of the adversaries which seems a matter of life and death, which is played out as such (or else one could never send people to get themselves killed in this kind of thing), behind this simulacrum of fighting to the death and of ruthless global stakes, the two adversaries are fundamentally in solidarity against something else

This something else is never defined (? why) but encapsulates:

> Tribal, communitarian, precapitalist structures, every form of exchange, of language, of symbolic organization, that is what must be abolished, that is the object of murder in war - and war itself, in its immense, spectacular death apparatus, is nothing but the medium of this process of the terrorist rationalization of the social - the murder on which sociality will be founded, whatever its allegiance, Communist or capitalist.

The Suez oil crisis was a manufactured event by the US to drive oil prices down so that Russia would lose money

> all "newsreel" footage thus gives the sinister impression of kitsch, of retro and porno at the same time - doubtless everyone knows this, and no one really accepts it. The reality of simulation is unbearable - crueler than Artaud's Theater of Cruelty, which was still an attempt to create a dramaturgy of life, the last gasp of an ideality of the body, of blood, of violence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a reabsorption of all the stakes without a trace of blood. For us the trick has been played. All dramaturgy, and even all real writing of cruelty has disappeared. Simulation is the master, and we only have a right to the retro, to the phantom, parodic rehabilitation of all lost referentials.


Commenting on the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction: 
>The same goes for the atomic reactors that we have already sent them: so many neutron bombs knocking out all historical virulence, all risk of explosion. In this sense, the nuclear everywhere inaugurates an accelerated process of implosion, it freezes everything around it, it absorbs all living energy.

The aporia of modern revolution and the paradox of the nuclear: 
> Lockdown and control increase in direct proportion to (and undoubtedly even faster than) liberating potentialities. Energies freeze in their own fire, they deter themselves

Baudrillard uses a really nice phrase here, the "decline of strong referentials". This connects to the common 4chan/internet refrain of the Great Spiritual War (the existential crisis facing today's white males lacking a world war or depression), and to the modern economic saga of Mediocrity which Ribbonfarm is so fond of referring to.

> The great event of this period, the great trauma, is this decline of strong referentials, these death pangs of the real and of the rational that open onto an age of simulation.

And here it is reminiscent of Francis Fukayama's End of History, in which the worldwide spread of liberal democracies removes the need for recording current events:

> It is into this void that the phantasms of a past history recede, the panoply of events, ideologies, retro fashions - no longer so much because people believe in them or still place some hope in them, but simply to resurrect the period when at least there was history, at least there was violence (albeit fascist), when at least life and death were at stake.

This loss of life and death stakes with no reduction in ferocity describes, among other things, the ollege admissions process pretty well: the first, greatest battle for status, in a nation-tribe which comprises the entire United States. Occasionally you can find reactionary calls for a return to a single test like the chinese *Gao Kao*, where the stakes seem simpler and deadlier.

I think the idea of hyperreality is becoming more clear to me now, at least in the way it is used to describe media. It is precisely the "perfect imperfection", the exemplary bell curve normal distribution of balls through a wall of pins:

> Take The Last Picture Show: like me, you would have had to be sufficiently distracted to have thought it to be an original production from the 1950s: a very good film about the customs in and the atmosphere of the American small town. Just a slight suspicion: it was a little too good, more in tune, better than the others, without the psychological, moral, and sentimental blotches of the films of that era. Stupefaction when one discovers that it is a 1970s film, perfect retro, purged, pure, the hyperrealist restitution of 1950s cinema.

It was against this hyperreality which I termed "the allegiance of the real", or second-order entropy. In Vlogs, college tours and the like the buildings in Vermont, in Pennsylvania, in Virginia and Illinois are recognizable not in their form but in *the way* they are seen, the camera angles and the light and the imperfectness which makes them the allies of my own reality. It is a disorder that is not perfectly disordered, hair swept back which has not achieved an improbably pleasing random arrangement of strands. 

This movement of cinema, art imitating life is memorably described as a *puritan and terrorist vision*. 
>The cinema in its current efforts is getting closer and closer, and with greater and greater perfection, to the absolute real, in its banality, its veracity, in its naked obviousness, in its boredom, and at the same time in its presumption, in its pretension to being the real, the immediate, the unsignified, which is the craziest of undertakings (similarly, functionalism's pretension to designating - design - the greatest degree of correspondence between the object and its function, and its use value, is a truly absurd enterprise); no culture has ever had toward its signs this naive and paranoid, puritan and terrorist vision.


## on the holocaust

History is part of history.
>Forgetting extermination is part of extermination, because it is also the extermination of memory, of history, of the social, etc. This forgetting is as essential as the event, in any case unlocatable by us, inaccessible to us in its truth.

On rekindling the "warmth " of history, of realizing the actual import of Auschwitz through a cold medium of television:

> from the cold to the cold, the social inertia of cold systems, of TV in particular. It was thus necessary that the whole world mobilize itself to remake the social, a hot social, heated discussion, hence communication, from the cold monster of extermination. One lacks stakes, investment, history, speech. That is the fundamental problem. The objective is thus to produce them at all cost, and this broadcast served this purpose: to capture the artificial heat of a dead event to warm the dead body of the social. Whence the addition of the supplementary medium to expand on the effect through feedback: immediate polls sanctioning the massive effect of the broadcast, the collective impact of the message - whereas it is well understood that the polls only verify the televisual success of the medium itself. But this confusion will never be lifted. From there, it is necessary to speak of the cold light of television, why it is harmless to the imagination (including that of children) because it no longer carries any imaginary and this for the simple reason that it is no longer an image.

TV Bad!!! I really can't get anything else out of this.

> Nothing of any of this in the "TV" image, which suggests nothing, which mesmerizes, which itself is nothing but a screen, not even that: a miniaturized terminal that, in fact, is immediately located in your head - you are the screen, and the TV watches you - it transistorizes all the neurons and passes through like a magnetic tape - a tape, not an image.

[[Black Swan]]
The collision of the abstract with reality

Theme #1: the occurrence of that which is extraordinarily rare

“Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky.” Everytime I try to make art, or write code, or do anything but comprend the vast scale of human misery and suffering I can’t help but wonder if it’s worth anything in the end. If we’re all going to die in the end what’s the purpose behind academic intrigue? 

Grand: someone who embodies abstract good upbringing and taste, yet functions in a sad and useless positiofn: reassuring, that in a world where frivolous hobbies exist how can death be arbitrary?

Theme #2: common feelings, commonality: not under quarantine, but of isolated unity. We must believe that the world continues to exist. We need to reassure ourselves that there is something beyond the individual home that we have been bound to collectively.

Kindly well meaning speakers tried to voice their fellow-feeling, and indeed did so, but at the same time proved the utter incapacity of every man truly to share in suffering that he cannot see. “Oran! Oran!” “Oran, we’re with you!” they called emotionally. But not, the doctor told himself, to love or to die together-- “and that’s the only way. They’re too remote.”

Life 
Well; we’re all in this one together. 

"Plagues and wars occur with equal frequency; so why is it when ... "
Death and dying is arbitrary; it makes life absurd; war gives us a reason for it but at its core our existence is very tenuous. 

Tarrou: “Query: How contrive not to waste one’s time? By being fully aware of it all the while: by spending one’s days on an uneasy chair in a dentist’s waiting-room; by remaining on one’s balcony all a sunday afternoon; by listening to lectures in a language one doesn’t know”

Paneloux: Calamity has come, and you deserved it!” God-motivated death. Doesn’t achieve the spiritual blessing that he wants; but he dies, so isn’t it the same in the end? “In the case of Paneloux, what folllowed whas to show that this uncertainty had no consquence”

It can’t happen to us.
Did we do things too late?
Trust in government. Maybe it will change after the virus is gone.

We’ve moved our lives online.

We are still playing the waiting game.

At the beginning of the plague they had a vivid recollection of the absent ones and bittlerly felt their loss. : even shadows can waste away.

In the memories of those who lived through them, the grim days of plague do not stand out like vivid flames, ravenous and inextinguishable, beaconing a troubled sky, but rather like the slow deliberate progress of some monstrous thing crushing out all upon its path.

“The plague did its job, that being to kill people, and sunk back into the cave from which it came..”

Things that were once intensely personal become shared feelings: the ache of separation. Things that were once abstract become frightening real; or else, they seem to melt away.

Narrator’s depiction of the “hectic exaltation” of the ordinary people trapped in the epidemic’s bubble, who fought their sense of isolation by dressing up, strolling aimlessly along Oran’s boulevards; and splashing out at restaurants, poised to flee should a fellow diner fall ill, caught up in “the frantic desire for life that thrives in the heart of every great calamity”:

The first commonality is denial. Even as evidence mounts that no one is immune to the plague, the residents of Oran refuse to believe or worry much about it – much like the Spring Break revelers who frolicked this week on Florida beaches. “When a war breaks out, people say: ‘It’s too stupid; it can’t last long,’” the novel’s narrator observes. “Stupidity has a knack of getting its way, as we should see if we were not always so much wrapped up in ourselves.”

Life seems very very normal for a world that has been essentially stopped. Can people live at home? How great is the struggle of the first-world separation? Everything--reddit, games, the food seems as normal as it was before (BUBBLE)?

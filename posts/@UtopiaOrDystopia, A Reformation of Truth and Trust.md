[[postmodernism]]
[[Media and Culture]]

We’ve known since Kant that the “thing in itself” lies just outside our reach, and since Nietzsche that we’re all liars. The lessons of social construction have been deeply embedded in anthropology and sociology, and infuses philosophy through the lucid caterwaul of postmodernism and the workaday plodding of pragmatism.

- Jean Baudrillard *Simulacra and Simulation* (1981)
  ... tried to put his finger on exactly what the West had lost when its belief in Truth- like God and morality before it --> We’re thus left without the comforts of either realism or religion, and it’s into this vacuum that the flood of commodified and infinitely replicable simulations and simulacra will pour.
  
  -fundamental separation from [[thing-in-itself]]We had known since Plato how far our idea of the real likely diverged from the real itself with the tasks of philosophy being to uncover this hidden truth from its occlusion by human biology and historical prejudice.
  
  ... [[Nietzsche]] amplified [[Kant]]’s received recognition that the truth was unknowable into an explosion and concluded that what we called the truth was a mere weapon of power. 
  
  ==Much of 20th century philosophy- the linguistic turn begun by [[Wittgenstein]], the critique of the media articulated by the Frankfurt School – has been footnotes to Nietzsche s conclusion that the will to truth is inseparable from the will to power== (And western philosophy in general are "footnotes" to Plato.)

I don't agree with this conclusion, these are misleading representations of organizations. Misinformation/disinformation is less widespread than believed. Media is not this strong of a political force by itself.
  
Baudrillard published Simulacra and Simulation in 1981 and we’ve fall much, much further down the rabbit hole since. On the political level- Ronald Reagan may have been an actor but he had also been the governor of the country’s richest and most populous state- California. Trump, by contrast, is a mere media construction, either that or something eerily similar to the tyrannical character Plato claimed democracies always create. Partly it was the sheer lack of trust that the media was telling the truth about his inadequacies that helped get Trump elected, but almost all institutions appear to be crumbling under this loss of public trust. ISIS. the most successful terrorist organization of our generation has been as much a media production company as anything else.

Every year advertising becomes more and more intimate with our bodies and our senses are quietly subsumed by those whose interests advertising serves, just as the fakes we create- our images and automatons- become ever more confusable with the real.

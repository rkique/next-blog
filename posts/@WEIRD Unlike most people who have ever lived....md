Unlike much of the world today, and most people who have ever lived, WEIRD people are highly individualistic, self-obsessed, control-oriented, nonconformist, and analytical. They focus on themselves―their attributes, accomplishments, and aspirations―over their relationships and social roles. How did WEIRD populations become so psychologically distinct? What role did these psychological differences play in the industrial revolution and the global expansion of Europe during the last few centuries?

The answer is the medieval Catholic Church.

Observations
### Massively biased samples, psychological diversity and peculiarity 
==Most of what was known experimentally about human psychology and behavior was based on studies with undergraduates from Western societies. ==At the time, 96 percent of experimental participants were drawn from northern Europe, North America, or Australia, and about 70 percent of these were American undergraduates.
When cross-cultural data were available from multiple populations, Western samples typically anchored the extreme end of the distribution. They were psychologically weird.

==there is a part of your brain which is responsible for understanding language==

For processing letters and words, a Letterbox develops in the left ventral occipito-temporal region, which connects with nearby regions for object recognition, language, and speech. Brain injuries that damage the Letterbox cause illiteracy.

Although this cognitive ability is culturally constructed, it’s also automatic, unconscious, and irrepressible. This makes it like many other aspects of culture.

# anti-nepotism is rare
we WEIRD people show relatively less favoritism toward our friends, families, co-ethnics, and local communities than other populations do. We think nepotism is wrong, and fetishize abstract principles over context, practicality, relationships, and expediency.

This led to the rise of the West...

... we’ll see that one sect of Christianity drove the spread of a particular package of social norms and beliefs that dramatically altered marriage, families, inheritance, and ownership in parts of Europe over centuries. This grassroots transformation of family life initiated a set of psychological changes that spurred new forms of urbanization and fueled impersonal commerce while driving the proliferation of voluntary organizations, from merchant guilds and charter towns to universities and transregional monastic orders, that were governed by new and increasingly individualistic norms and laws.

>If a team of alien anthropologists had surveyed humanity from orbit in 1000 CE, or even 1200 CE, they would never have guessed that European populations would dominate the globe during the second half of the millennium. Instead, they probably would have bet on China or the Islamic world.1

# Identity

Americans are much more likely to identify by personal attributes and abstract ideals than interpersonal relationships.

>This focus on personal attributes, achievements, and membership in abstract or idealized social groups over personal relationships, inherited social roles, and face-to-face communities is a robust feature of WEIRD psychology, but one that makes us rather peculiar from a global perspective.

For the majority of human history, familial obligation has been common...

> Within these enduring networks, everyone is endowed with an extensive array of inherited obligations, responsibilities, and privileges in relation to others in a dense social web. For example, a man could be obligated to avenge the murder of one type of second cousin (through his paternal great-grandfather), privileged to marry his mother’s brother’s daughters but tabooed from marrying strangers, and responsible for performing expensive rituals to honor his ancestors, who will shower bad luck on his entire lineage if he’s negligent.

In contrast: the necessity of individualism today.

>Imagine the psychology needed to navigate a world with few inherited ties in which success and respect depend on (1) honing one’s own special attributes; (2) attracting friends, mates, and business partners with these attributes; and then (3) sustaining relationships with them that will endure for as long as the relationship remains mutually beneficial. In this world, everyone is shopping for better relationships, which may or may not endure. People have few permanent ties and many ephemeral friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. In adapting psychologically to this world, people come to see themselves and others as independent agents defined by a unique or special set of talents (e.g., writer), interests (e.g., quilting), aspirations (e.g., making law partner), virtues (e.g., fairness), and principles (e.g., “no one is above the law”). These can be enhanced or accentuated if a person joins a like-minded group.

==This individualism has largely been an *effect* of liberalism and wealth, reflecting a confidence in fairness and inviolate state.==

> Now, it’s commonly assumed that the strong positive relationships between psychological individualism and measures like national wealth and effective governments reflect a one-way causal process in which economic prosperity or liberal political institutions cause greater individualism. I certainly think that causality does indeed flow in this direction for some aspects of psychology, and probably dominates the economic and urbanization processes in much of the world today.

However, the author of this book argues that if some other factor (the christian religion) created individual psychology, it stimulates urbanization, commercial markets, prosperity, innovation, and the creation of new forms of government. ...


Consistency WITHIN contexts vs consistency ACROSS contexts (Eastern, Western)

> The result is that while Americans sometimes see behavioral flexibility as “two-faced” or “hypocritical,” many other populations see personal adjustments to differing relationships as reflecting wisdom, maturity, and social adeptness

In Korea, being consistent doesn’t buy you anything socially. The value that WEIRD people place in consistency leads to dispositionalism: a tendency to see people’s behavior as anchored in personal traits that influence their actions across many contexts. [[deontology]]

# shame vs guilt
people from more individualistic societies report more guilt-like and fewer shame-like emotional experiences.

Shame is the social devaluation in the eyes of others. 

The feeling of guilt emerges when one measures their own actions and feelings against a purely personal standard.

[[$Peer Pressure, Solomon Asch]]

WEIRD people conform less than all the other populations that have been studied. The bars in Figure 1.3 illustrate the size of the conformity effect across samples of undergraduates from 10 different countries. The power of conformity goes up by a factor of three as we move from WEIRD societies, at one end, to Zimbabwe, at the other end.

[[$Temporal Discounting]]

WEIRD people are good at delayed gratification.

2002 corruption is correlated to diplomats parking tickets.


# impersonal prosociality
impersonal prosociality, which is associated with a set of social norms, expectations, and motivations for impartial fairness, probity, and cooperation with strangers, anonymous others, or even abstract institutions like the police or government. 

Impersonal prosociality also includes motivations, heuristics, and strategies for punishing those who break impartial norms.

Impartial principles over contextual particularism

■  Trust, fairness, honesty, and cooperation with anonymous others, strangers, and impersonal institutions (e.g., government)
■  An emphasis on mental states, especially in moral judgment
■  Muted concerns for revenge but willingness to punish third parties
■  Reduced in-group favoritism
■  Free will: notion that individuals make their own choices and those choices matter
■  Moral universalism: thinking that moral truths exist in the way mathematical laws exist
■  Linear time and notions of progress

- over 90 percent of participants in experimental studies remain WEIRD

Besides influencing who we learn from, natural selection has also shaped what we pay attention to—like food, sex, and gossip—and how we process, store, and organize particular kinds of beliefs and preferences.


==When to learn from others: This brings us to the question of when learners should rely on cultural learning over their own experience, personal information, or instincts. The answer is straightforward: when problems are difficult, situations are ambiguous, or individual learning is costly, people should rely more heavily on learning from others. ==

==How can one even begin to speak of dignity in labor when one secretly feels one’s job should not exist?==

### meta
David Graeber was a famous anthropologist and anarchist. This book was published in 2018, and came out of an essay published in 2013. It is essentially about the idea of "busy work". 

An interesting note in the context of Lakeside: although individual assignments are not usually seen as busywork, the worth of broader instructional methods and subjects are much less certain. Considered as a whole, I'm not sure if going to Lakeside has really taught me more than online education would have. 

There's an interesting paradox there: during COVID, private schools need to claim that they can provide a comparable level of education online. But then this new claim contradicts the original value proposition of the school! Going back to school as soon as possible makes a lot of economic sense for schools like Lakeside.

### preface

Graeber summarizes the message from his essay from 2013.

>In the year 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century’s end, technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would have achieved a fifteen-hour work week. There’s every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn’t happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless.

Graeber DOES NOT do a consumerism preach. 

>The standard line today is that [Keynes] didn’t figure in the massive increase in consumerism. Given the choice between less hours and more toys and pleasures, we’ve collectively chosen the latter.
>This presents a nice morality tale, but even a moment’s reflection shows it can’t really be true. Yes, we have witnessed the creation of an endless variety of new jobs and industries since the twenties, but very few have anything to do with the production and distribution of sushi, iPhones, or fancy sneakers.

Instead of consumerism ruining leisure, productive jobs has simply been traded for unproductive jobs; bullshit jobs. It's an huge increase; from 1/4 to 3/4 of total employment! 

> Over the course of the last century, the number of workers employed as domestic servants, in industry, and in the farm sector has collapsed dramatically. At the same time, **“professional, managerial, clerical, sales, and service workers”** tripled, growing “from one-quarter to three-quarters of total employment.”

>rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world’s population to pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning not even so much of the “service” sector as of the administrative sector, up to and including the creation of whole new industries like financial services or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of sectors like corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources, and public relations. And these numbers do not even reflect all those people whose job is to provide administrative, technical, or security support for these industries, or, for that matter, the whole host of ancillary industries (dog washers, all-night pizza deliverymen) that only exist because everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones.

 > These are what I propose to call “bullshit jobs.”

This isn't supposed to happen in capitalism. Markets are supposed to fix these inefficiencies. So why don't they? Graeber makes a bold claim:

> The answer clearly isn’t economic: it’s moral and political. The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger. And, on the other hand, the feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.

One immediate objection to Graeber's claim is that there is no good way to define a "necessary job". He responds by pointing to the huge numbers of people who find their own jobs meaningless, like an old friend of his who was a rock band singer turned corporate lawyer. Many salaried professionals, he claims, are actually self aware: they avoid discussing their own line of work and believe their jobs are pointless and stupid.

> it is the peculiar genius of our society that its rulers have figured out a way, as in the case of the fish fryers, to ensure that rage is directed precisely against those who actually do get to do meaningful work. 
> For instance: in our society, there seems to be a general rule that, the more obviously one’s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it.

As a general rule, Graeber claims that impactful jobs pay less. Bullshit jobs pay more. Apart from a handful of well-touted exceptions (doctors), he claims the rule holds surprisingly well.

I'm not sure if there is that much wrong with this statement in generally describing the reality of the job market. Obviously dignity in your labor has some value. You will, almost certainly, make less money going into computational biology than software engineering, because you get to work on more important things. Make less money going to work for SpaceX than any of its competitors. The meaningfulness of the work is and should be factored into a job market. 

What I agree with here is that a system where the elite restrict the overall worth of jobs is unjust. The cumulative dignity * compensation afforded to workers should allow people to get decent levels of meaning and money from their job. 

In the wake of the release of his essay, 37% of people responding to a YouGov poll said that their job did not make a meaningful contribution to the world.

Graeber implicates the creation of bullshit jobs as part of neoliberalism, and the work of a political elite gaining more and more power. Neoliberalism and freer markets led to economic stagnation and the consolidation of power:

> while they might have been concerned with declining economic indicators, they were also quite delighted to note that the combination of globalization, gutting the power of unions, and creating an insecure and overworked workforce—along with aggressively paying lip service to sixties calls to hedonistic personal liberation (what came to be known as “lifestyle liberalism, fiscal conservativism”)—had the effect of simultaneously shifting more and more wealth and power to the wealthy and almost completely destroying the basis for organized challenges to their power. It might not have worked very well economically, but politically it worked like a dream.

He calls this an *anticonspiracy theory*, although it still seems a lot like a conspiracy theory to me:

>This is less a conspiracy theory approach than it is an anticonspiracy theory. I was asking why action wasn’t taken. ... The proliferation of bullshit jobs, as we’ll see, happened for a variety of reasons. The real question I was asking is why no one intervened (“conspired,” if you like) to do something about the matter.

Nice quote:
> I would like this book to be an arrow aimed at the heart of our civilization. There is something very wrong with what we have made ourselves. We have become a civilization based on work—not even “productive work” but work as an end and meaning in itself.

### quick reflection

>i notice eric focuses a lot on the technologies which drive social change
there’s certainly some merit to that angle
>but i think he’s too hyperfixated on it

Harry's right. What creates my fixation on technosolutionism? 

Most of it is probably because I read tech blogs which tend to focus on tech developments. Some of it is probably because technological power post *The Social Network* seems equivalent to social power, e.g. through network effects. And network effects really are powerful. 

More cynically, bourgeoisie elementary school education "good engineer" ideas of change tend to be these really ingenous, creative non-extractive marginal revolution/ improvement in material circumstances which bring about a better future. But shouldn't that be plan A? Why give up before you've even started?


### chapter 1: what is a bullshit job?

Graeber runs away with the idea of self-awareness as the essential quality for a bullshit job:
> Provisional Definition: a bullshit job is a form of employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence.

They don't only exist in public sector:

>If these cases are anything to go by, the main difference between the public and private sectors is not that either is more, or less, likely to generate pointless work. It does not even necessarily lie in the kind of pointless work each tends to generate. The main difference is that pointless work in the private sector is likely to be far more closely supervised.

Veering into simulacra and simulation territory, Graeber refines the definition as follows:

> Final Working Definition: a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.

Furthermore, they are right about this judgement of their own job's social value. Graeber says that "the worker’s perspective is about as close as one is likely to get to an accurate assessment of the situation".

There are two distinctions, one is just crooks:
> It’s my impression that genuinely powerful corporate lawyers think their roles are entirely legitimate. Or perhaps they simply don’t care whether they’re doing good or harm.
> at the commanding heights of the financial system, we’re not actually talking about bullshit jobs. We’re not even talking about people who have come to believe their own propagandists. Really we’re just talking about a bunch of crooks.

The other is just shit jobs, which are usually blue collar. They typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society; it’s just that the workers who do them are paid and treated badly.

>Those who work shit jobs tend to be the object of indignities; they not only work hard but also are held in low esteem for that very reason. But at least they know they’re doing something useful.

Quotes Dostoyevsky on the torture of meaningless labor, and sisyphean tasks:

> Hard labor, as it is now carried on, presents no interest to the convict; but it has its utility. The convict makes bricks, digs the earth, builds; and all his occupations have a meaning and an end. Sometimes the prisoner may even take an interest in what he is doing. He then wishes to work more skillfully, more advantageously. But let him be constrained to pour water from one vessel into another, to pound sand, to move a heap of earth from one place to another, and then immediately move it back again, then I am persuaded that at the end of a few days, the prisoner would hang himself or commit a thousand capital crimes, preferring rather to die than endure such humiliation, shame, and torture.

Most retail workers do not think their jobs are entirely useless. Graeber hones in on three industries within the retail sector which do think so: IT workers, telemarketers, and sex workers. First two believe they are scamming consumers. Last one shows that any society with a sex industry is a "bullshit society". 



### chapter two to many: 5 categories of pointless jobs

These jobs are largely in the private sector. Graeber credits the Christy Puritan-Capitalist work ethic for making the labor of capitalism religious duty. Graeber holds that work as a source of virtue is a recent idea, that work was disdained by the aristocracy in classical times (e.g. Ancient Rome), but inverted as virtuous through then-radical philosophers like John Locke. The Puritan idea of virtue through suffering justified the toil of the working classes as noble.


FLUNKIES
serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants. These are the modern equivalent of fuedal retainers, and serve roles as Badges of Seriousness or Badges of Importance and the like. If you didn’t have underlings, you couldn’t really claim to be a noble.

GOONs
who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists. This also refers to national armed forces, of which it would be great if we could dissolve them, though disarmanent seems to be a really hard issue.

On advertising:

>My job is a combination of manufacturing demand and then exaggerating the usefulness of the products sold to fix it. In fact, you could argue that that is the job of every single person that works in or for the entire advertising industry. If we’re at the point where in order to sell products, you have to first of all trick people into thinking they need them, then I think you’d be hard-pressed to argue that these jobs aren’t bullshit

These jobs are bullshit because they involve aggression and deception.

DUCT TAPERS
>What makes such a role bullshit is when the plan obviously can’t work and any competent architect should have known it; when the system is so stupidly designed that it will fail in completely predictable ways, but rather than fix the problem, the organization prefers to hire full-time employees whose main or entire job is to deal with the damage. It’s as if a homeowner, upon discovering a leak in the roof, decided it was too much bother to hire a roofer to reshingle it, and instead stuck a bucket underneath and hired someone whose full-time job was to periodically dump the water.
> It goes without saying that duct tapers are almost always aware they have a bullshit job and are usually quite angry about it.
>who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently, e.g., programmers repairing shoddy code, airline desk staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive

BOX TICKERS
employees who exist only or primarily to allow an organization to be able to claim it is doing something that, in fact, it is not doing. e.g., survey administrators, in-house magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers. This is a fundamental failing of bureaucratic governance aka [[@Ribbonfarm Seeing as a State]], and Graeber acknowledges this:

> Of course, on some level, all bureaucracies work on this principle: once you introduce formal measures of success, “reality”—for the organization—becomes that which exists on paper, and the human reality that lies behind it is a secondary consideration at best.

The physical appearance (aptly termed "deliverables" in the business world) are all important.

>Many of these reports are nothing more than props in a Kabuki-like corporate theater—no one actually reads them all the way through.

> it is very easy to charge a very large amount of money to write bullshit reports. I was recently able to charge around twelve thousand pounds to write a two-page report for a pharmaceutical client to present during a global strategy meeting. The report wasn’t used in the end because they didn’t manage to get to that agenda point during their allotted meeting time, but the team I wrote it for was very happy with it nonetheless.


The corporate compliance industry might be considered an intermediary form. It is explicitly created by (US) government regulation:

TASKMASTERS who manage—or create extra work for—those who do not need it, e.g., middle management, leadership professionals


Zoom Game Hosts

>One compelling suggestion I heard was for a category of “imaginary friends”—that is, people hired ostensibly to humanize an inhuman corporate environment but who, in fact, mainly force people to go through elaborate games of make-believe. We will be hearing about forced “creativity” and “mindfulness” seminars and obligatory charity events later on; there are workers whose entire careers are based on dressing up in costumes or otherwise designing silly games to create rapport in office environments where everyone would probably be happier just being left alone. These could be seen as box tickers of a sort, but they could equally be seen as a phenomenon unto themselves.


On mindfulness seminars:

>It’s as if they first forbid you to acknowledge you are engaging in empty ritual, then force you to attend seminars where hired gurus tell you, “In the final analysis, isn’t everything we do just empty ritual?”

>being forced to scam someone is altogether different. In such circumstances, it’s hard not to feel you’re ultimately in the same situation as the person you’re scamming: you’re both being pressured and manipulated by your employer, only in your case, with the added indignity that you’re also betraying the trust of someone whose side you should be on.

This is too radical:

>If the argument of the previous section is correct, one could perhaps conclude that Eric’s problem was just that he hadn’t been sufficiently prepared for the pointlessness of the modern workplace. He had passed through the old education system—some traces of it are left—designed to prepare students to actually do things. This led to false expectations and an initial shock of disillusionment that he could not overcome.

### :O nature of work

>We may begin by asking why we assume that someone being paid to do nothing should consider himself fortunate.

>According to classical economic theory, homo oeconomicus, or “economic man”—that is, the model human being that lies behind every prediction made by the discipline—is assumed to be motivated above all by a calculus of costs and benefits. All the mathematical equations by which economists bedazzle their clients, or the public, are founded on one simple assumption: that everyone, left to his own devices, will choose the course of action that provides the most of what he wants for the least expenditure of resources and effort. It is the simplicity of the formula that makes the equations possible: if one were to admit that humans have complicated motivations, there would be too many factors to take into account, it would be impossible to properly weight them, and predictions could not be made.

>...The underlying assumption is that if humans are offered the option to be parasites, of course they’ll take it.

This is, as Graeber shows, not true. 

> To choose a couple of particularly colorful examples: working-class people who win the lottery and find themselves multimillionaires rarely quit their jobs (and if they do, usually they soon say they regret it)
> ...we now know that placing prisoners in solitary confinement for more than six months at a stretch inevitably results in physically observable forms of brain damage. Human beings are not just social animals; they are so intrinsically social that if they are cut off from relations with other humans, they begin to decay physically.

The pleasure of being the cause or the [[Nietzche]]an WILL TO POWER:

> As early as 1901, the German psychologist Karl Groos discovered that infants express extraordinary happiness when they first figure out they can cause predictable effects in the world, pretty much regardless of what that effect is or whether it could be construed as having any benefit to them. Let’s say they discover that they can move a pencil by randomly moving their arms. Then they realize they can achieve the same effect by moving in the same pattern again. Expressions of utter joy ensue. Groos coined the phrase “the pleasure at being the cause,” suggesting that it is the basis for play, which he saw as the exercise of powers simply for the sake of exercising them.

> It is hard perhaps to think of our sense of self as grounded in action because when we are truly engrossed in doing something—especially something we know how to do very well, from running a race to solving a complicated logical problem—we tend to forget that we exist. But even as we dissolve into what we do, the foundational “pleasure at being the cause” remains, as it were, the unstated ground of our being.

>It’s not just an assault on the person’s sense of self-importance but also a direct attack on the very foundations of the sense that one even is a self. A human being unable to have a meaningful impact on the world ceases to exist.

>If make-believe play is the purest expression of human freedom, make-believe work imposed by others is the purest expression of lack of freedom.

The WORK HARD PLAY HARD mentality is that of a fuedal lord: bursts of extreme excitement "dramatic feats of arms" and increased priviledges accordingly.

> Feudal lords, insofar as they worked at all, were fighters16—their lives tended to alternate between dramatic feats of arms and near-total idleness and torpor. Peasants and servants obviously were expected to work more steadily. But even so, their work schedule was nothing remotely as regular or disciplined as the current nine-to-five—the typical medieval serf, male or female, probably worked from dawn to dusk for twenty to thirty days out of any year, but just a few hours a day otherwise, and on feast days, not at all. And feast days were not infrequent.

>This is important to underline because the idea that one person’s time can belong to someone else is actually quite peculiar. Most human societies that have ever existed would never have conceived of such a thing. As the great classicist Moses Finley pointed out: if an ancient Greek or Roman saw a potter, he could imagine buying his pots. He could also imagine buying the potter—slavery was a familiar institution in the ancient world. But he would have simply been baffled by the notion that he might buy the potter’s time.
>
>As Finley observes, any such notion would have to involve two conceptual leaps which even the most sophisticated Roman legal theorists found difficult: first, to think of the potter’s capacity to work, his “labor-power,” as a thing that was distinct from the potter himself, and second, to devise some way to pour that capacity out, as it were, into uniform temporal containers—hours, days, work shifts—that could then be purchased, using cash. To the average Athenian or Roman, such ideas would have likely seemed weird, exotic, even mystical. How could you buy time? Time is an abstraction!

>So how did we get to the situation we see today, where it’s considered perfectly natural for free citizens of democratic countries to rent themselves out in this way, or for a boss to become indignant if employees are not working every moment of “his” time?

>First of all, it had to involve a change in the common conception of what time actually was. Human beings have long been acquainted with the notion of absolute, or sidereal, time by observing the heavens, where celestial events happen with exact and predictable regularity. But the skies are typically treated as the domain of perfection. Priests or monks might organize their lives around celestial time, but life on earth was typically assumed to be messier. Below the heavens, there is no absolute yardstick to apply. To give an obvious example: if there are twelve hours from dawn to dusk, there’s little point saying a place is three hours’ walk away when you don’t know the season when someone is traveling, since winter hours will be half the length of summer ones. When I lived in Madagascar, I found that rural people—who had little use for clocks—still often described distance the old-fashioned way and said that to walk to another village would take two cookings of a pot of rice. In medieval Europe, people spoke similarly of something as taking “three paternosters,” or two boilings of an egg. This sort of thing is extremely common. In places without clocks, time is measured by actions rather than action being measured by time. 

(There is a classic statement on the subject by the anthropologist Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard on the subject; he’s speaking of the Nuer, a pastoral people of East Africa:

> [T]he Nuer have no expression equivalent to “time” in our language, and they cannot, therefore, as we can, speak of time as though it were something actual, which passes, can be wasted, can be saved, and so forth. I do not think that they ever experience the same feeling of fighting against time or having to coordinate activities with an abstract passage of time, because their points of reference are mainly the activities themselves, which are generally of a leisurely character. Events follow a logical order, but they are not controlled by an abstract system, there being no autonomous points of reference to which activities have to conform with precision. Nuer are fortunate.)

>Time is not a grid against which work can be measured, because the work is the measure itself.

>The English historian E. P. Thompson, who wrote a magnificent 1967 essay on the origins of the modern time sense called “Time, Work Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism,”23 pointed out that what happened were simultaneous moral and technological changes, each propelling the other. By the fourteenth century, most European towns had created clock towers—usually funded and encouraged by the local merchant guild. It was these same merchants who developed the habit of placing human skulls on their desks as memento mori, to remind themselves that they should make good use of their time because each chime of the clock brought them one hour closer to death.24 The dissemination of domestic clocks and then pocket watches took much longer, coinciding largely with the advent of the industrial revolution beginning in the late 1700s, but once it did happen, it allowed for similar attitudes to diffuse among the middle classes more generally. Sidereal time, the absolute time of the heavens, had to come to earth and began to regulate even the most intimate daily affairs. But time was simultaneously a fixed grid, and a possession. Everyone was encouraged to see time as did the medieval merchant: as a finite property to be carefully budgeted and disposed of, much like money. What’s more, the new technologies also allowed any person’s fixed time on earth to be chopped up into uniform units that could be bought and sold for money.

>Once time was money, it became possible to speak of “spending time,” rather than just “passing” it—also of wasting time, killing time, saving time, losing time, racing against time, and so forth. Puritan, Methodist, and evangelical preachers soon began instructing their flocks about the “husbandry of time,” proposing that the careful budgeting of time was the essence of morality. Factories began employing time clocks; workers came to be expected to punch the clock upon entering and leaving; charity schools designed to teach the poor discipline and punctuality gave way to public school systems where students of all social classes were made to get up and march from room to room each hour at the sound of a bell, an arrangement self-consciously designed to train children for future lives of paid factory labor.
> Modern work discipline and capitalist techniques of supervision have their own peculiar histories, too, as forms of total control first developed on merchant ships and slave plantations in the colonies were imposed on the working poor back home.26 But the new conception of time was what made it possible. What I want to underline here is that this was both a technological and a moral change. It is usually laid at the feet of Puritanism, and Puritanism certainly had something to do with it; but one could argue equally compellingly that the more dramatic forms of Calvinist asceticism were just overblown versions of a new time sense that was, in one way or another, reshaping the sensibilities of the middle classes across the Christian world. As a result, over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, starting in England, the old episodic style of working came increasingly to be viewed as a social problem. The middle classes came to see the poor as poor largely because they lacked time discipline; they spent their time recklessly, just as they gambled away their money.
> Meanwhile, workers rebelling against oppressive conditions began adopting the same language. Many early factories didn’t allow workers to bring their own timepieces, since the owner regularly played fast and loose with the factory clock. Before long, however, workers were arguing with employers about hourly rates, demanding fixed-hour contracts, overtime, time and a half, the twelve-hour day, and then the eight-hour day. But the very act of demanding “free time,” however understandable under the circumstances, had the effect of subtly reinforcing the idea that when a worker was “on the clock,” his time truly did belong to the person who had bought it—a concept that would have seemed perverse and outrageous to their great-grandparents, as, indeed, to most people who have ever lived.
> It’s impossible to understand the spiritual violence of modern work without understanding this history, which leads regularly to a direct clash between the morality of the employer and the common sense of the employee. No matter how much workers may have been conditioned in time discipline by primary schooling, they will see the demand to work continually at a steady pace for eight hours a day regardless of what there is to do as defying all common sense—and the pretend make-work they are instructed to perform as absolutely infuriating.27

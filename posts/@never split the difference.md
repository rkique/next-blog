negotiation advice from an FBI hostage negotiator

> “I’m sorry, Robert, how do I know he’s even alive?” I said, using an apology and his first name, seeding more warmth into the interaction in order to complicate his gambit to bulldoze me. “I really am sorry, but how can I get you any money right now, much less one million dollars, if I don’t even know he’s alive?”

> I was employing what had become one of the FBI’s most potent negotiating tools: the open-ended question.
> Today, after some years evolving these tactics for the private sector in my consultancy, The Black Swan Group, we call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys you time. It gives your counterpart the illusion of control—they are the one with the answers and power after all—and it does all that without giving them any idea of how constrained they are by it.

>I'm just asking questions. It's a passive-aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-ended questions over and over and over and over. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want.

> Andy would throw out an offer and give a rationally airtight explanation for why it was a good one—an inescapable logic trap—and I’d answer with some variation of “How am I supposed to do that?”

>I knew what she meant: While I wasn’t actually saying “No,” the questions I kept asking sounded like it. They seemed to insinuate that the other side was being dishonest and unfair.

Hostage disasters forced the US to get serious about hostage negotiation. 

1971: 39 hostages killed in the Attica prison riots
1971: George Giffe Jr. murders 2 hostages & self, FBI to blame

*Soon after the Giffe tragedy, the NYPD puts together a crisis negotiation team. The FBI follows soon after.*

1972: 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed

In the landmark Downs v. United States decision of 1975, the U.S. Court of Appeals wrote that “there was a better suited alternative to protecting the hostages’ well-being,” and said that the FBI had turned “what had been a successful ‘waiting game,’ during which two persons safely left the plane, into a ‘shooting match’ that left three persons dead.” 

> The court concluded that “a reasonable attempt at negotiations must be made prior to a tactical intervention.”


Two competing negotiation strategies: 

### Fisher and Ury's Getting to Yes
*The rational angle: Harvard*
Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenets.

One, separate the person—the emotion—from the problem; 

two, don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; 

three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options;

four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions

### Tversky and Kahneman
*The irrational angle: UChicago*
Cognitive biases fit into this field of behavioral economics, which posit that humans are inherently irrational.
> [I]t is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable.
Kahneman proved that humans all suffer from Cognitive Bias, that is, unconscious—and irrational—brain processes that literally distort the way we see the world. Kahneman and Tversky discovered more than 150 of them.

I don't know if these are correct -- 
> the most famous is Loss Aversion, which shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain.

After Ruby Ridge and Waco, in 1994 the Critical Incident Response Group was formed.

>It was clear: if emotionally driven incidents, not rational bargaining interactions, constituted the bulk of what most police negotiators had to deal with, then our negotiating skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational.

>From that moment onward, our emphasis would have to be not on training in quid pro quo bargaining and problem solving, but on education in the psychological skills needed in crisis intervention situations. Emotions and emotional intelligence would have to be central to effective negotiation, not things to be overcome.

>simple psychological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other guy of our empathy.

> Listening is the cheapest yet most effective concession we can make. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing. 

>Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible. 

>The problem was, we were in too much of a hurry, driving too hard toward a quick solution; **trying to be a problem solver, not a people mover.**

Late night FM DJ Voice: deep, soft, slow and reassuring

>Think of it as a kind of involuntary neurological telepathy—each of us in every given moment signaling to the world around us whether we are ready to play or fight, laugh or cry.

>When we radiate warmth and acceptance, conversations just seem to flow. When we enter a room with a level of comfort and enthusiasm, we attract people toward us. Smile at someone on the street, and as a reflex they’ll smile back. Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is critical to the success of just about every negotiating skill there is to learn.

>Most of the time, you should be using the positive/playful voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking. A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact tonally that the other person will pick up on.

Smile is constructive:
> When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility.

>And let’s not delude ourselves: whatever the enlightened rules of the “new school,” in every environment (work or otherwise) you will always have to deal with forceful type A people who prefer consent to collaboration.
>If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment.

>We didn’t just put ourselves in the fugitives’ shoes. We spotted their feelings, turned them into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to them.
>In a negotiation, that’s called labeling.
>Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person feels.

"It seems like", sounds like, looks like <--> PG's it turns out
It looks like

>Labeling negatives diffuses them (or defuses them, in extreme cases); labeling positives reinforces them.

Labeling allows you to acknowledge and take the substance out of the other person's arguments.

>“I wanted to inform you,” it read, “that in order to receive your tickets for the upcoming season opener against the New York Giants, you will need to pay your outstanding balance in full prior to September 10.”
>It was the stupidly aggressive, impersonal, tone-deaf style of communication that is the default for most business. It was all “me, me, me” from TJ, with no acknowledgment of the ticket holder’s situation. No empathy. No connection. Just give me the money.

The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, in what I call an accusation audit.

>“No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. We’ve been conditioned to fear the word “No.” But it is a statement of perception far more often than of fact. It seldom means, “I have considered all the facts and made a rational choice.” Instead, “No” is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is scary, and “No” provides a little protection from that scariness.

>Jim Camp, in his excellent book, Start with NO,1 counsels the reader to give their adversary (his word for counterpart) permission to say “No” from the outset of a negotiation. He calls it “the right to veto.” He observes that people will fight to the death to preserve their right to say “No,” so give them that right and the negotiating environment becomes more constructive and collaborative almost immediately.

What No actually means

■I am not yet ready to agree;

■You are making me feel uncomfortable;

■I do not understand;

■I don’t think I can afford it;

■I want something else;

■I need more information; or

■I want to talk it over with someone else.

Solution based responses
What about this doesn't work for you?
What would you need to make it work?
“It seems like there’s something here that bothers you.”

Autonomy is the ability for ironic detachment/ the ability to take any force and downplay it as a show of force. To take any advantage that the other side has and subject it to your own value system.

I’d like to present you with a guy named Joe Businessman as he readies himself for a negotiation. You’ve met him before. He’s the prepared type, with all his Getting to Yes strategies written out and memorized. And he’s more than ready to unleash them on the guy across the table. He is Russell Crowe in Gladiator. He is The Man. Now allow me to let you in on a secret: None of that preparation will mean a damn thing. His negotiation style is all me, me, me, ego, ego, ego.

Human beings the world over are so used to being pursued for the commitment “yes” as a condition to find out more that they have become masters at giving the counterfeit “yes.”

The counterfeit yes:
> It was all flowing, and our rapport was great. I even got Daryl to laugh a few times. By the time I was done with him, he couldn’t give me one reason not to step outside.
> “Thank you, Chris,” Daryl said just before he hung up. “Thanks for doing such a great job.”

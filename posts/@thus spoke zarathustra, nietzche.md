[[Nietzsche_KINGMUN_notes]]

Nietzche's writings features the overman/superman, someone who can transcend the traditional Christian morality which he describes in his earlier books (on the development of Christianity by slaves in ancient Rome).

This text also references the uncomfortable animal nature of human existence, [[denial of death]]
[[mind body duality]]

It also references the idea of the singularity, or the transhuman. [[@Gwern, Complexity no bar to AI]]

Much within you is still worm...
>"All beings so far have created something beyond themselves. Do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and revert back to the beast rather than surpass mankind? What is the ape to a man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just so shall a man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame. You have evolved from worm to man, but much within you is still worm. Once you were apes, yet even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes"

Happiness, reason, virtue, justice, pity: mankind does not engage in praxis enough. Nietzche says: if virtue hasn't driven you mad, it is not good enough. It is not HUMAN enough. This is the origin of the "madman in the desert" archetype, someone so resolutely driven by their morals as to disengage from society.

>"The hour when you say: 'What good is my happiness? It is poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency. But my happiness should justify existence itself!'

>"The hour when you say: 'What good is my reason? Does it long for knowledge as the lion for his prey? It is poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency!'

>"The hour when you say: 'What good is my virtue? It has not yet driven me mad! How weary I am of my good and my evil! It is all poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency!'

>"The hour when you say: 'What good is my justice? I do not see that I am filled with fire and burning coals. But the just are filled with fire and burning coals!'

>"The hour when you say: 'What good is my pity? Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loves man? But my pity is no crucifixion!'

Nietzche says: if you feel constantly morally downtrodden, or upset at the animal nature of human existence, you are at heart an over-goer, trending upwards:

> I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers. I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows of longing for the other shore.

The *despise* here should be seen as different from nihilism.

Nietzche loves very principled people (which curiously, seems to be his own driving principle/ moral valuation)

> I love him who makes his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more

There is an idea of subservience here:

>I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowers over man: they herald the coming of the lightning, and perish as heralds. Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud: the lightning, however, is Superman

This is a really nice poetic section, the language from which reminds me of the Little Prince. Nietzche describes a society which has failed (somewhat akin to Alduous Huxley's Brave New World):

>"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?"- so asks the last man, and blinks. The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes everything small. His species is ineradicable as the flea; the last man lives longest. "We have discovered happiness"- say the last men, and they blink. They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth. One still loves one's neighbor and rubs against him; for one needs warmth. Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbles over stones or men! One still works, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one. One no longer becomes poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wants to rule? Who still wants to obey? Both are too burdensome. No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wants the same; everyone is the same: he who has other sentiments goes voluntarily into the madhouse. "Formerly all the world was insane,"- say the subtlest of them, and they blink. They are clever and know all that has happened: so there is no end to their derision. People still quarrel, but are soon reconciled otherwise it upsets their stomachs. They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health. "We have discovered happiness,"- say the last men, and they blink

And the people want to be made into these last men. Nietzche sees them as weak.

>My soul is calm and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they think I am cold, and a mocker with terrible jests. Now they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate me too. There is ice in their laughter."

Nietzche's Zarathustra praises the tightrope walker on his deathbed:

>The man looked up distrustfully. "If you speak the truth," said he, "I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal which has been taught to dance by blows and a few scraps of food." "Not at all," said Zarathustra, "you have made danger your calling; there is nothing contemptible in that. Now you perish by your calling: therefore I will bury you with my own hands."

I'm skeptical of Nietzche characterizing the tightrope walker someone more of an "over-goer" than the others. You have made danger your calling? What is more excusable about the animal thrill of speed than any social indulgence? [[@The Futurist Manifesto]]. Perhaps because it is self-motivated and individual? I guess Nietzche likes any intrinsically motivating individual endeavor...

The good and just hate Zarathustra because he is speaking of something that no one can achieve (the superman): as Nietzche says in the birth of tragedy, civilization is neutralized by music in the same way lamplight is by daylight (richard wagner qtd. in [[@The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzche]])

>"Leave this town, O Zarathustra," said he, "there are too many here who hate you. The good and the just hate you, and call you their enemy and despiser; the believers in the orthodox belief hate you, and call you a danger to the multitude. It was your good fortune to be laughed at: and verily you spoke like a fool. It was your good fortune to stoop to the dead dog; by so lowering yourself you have saved your life today. Depart, however, from this town,- or tomorrow I shall jump over you, a living man over a dead one.

The creation of laws /banks is injust:

>Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? The man who breaks up their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker- yet he is the creator.

> I will join the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers: I will show them the rainbow, and all the steps to the Superman.

I am my own justification, rising above traditional morality:

> Who is the great dragon which the spirit no longer wants to call Lord and God? "Thou-shalt," is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion says, "I will."

Spirit becomes a camel to travel across the desert of the real to the great value-dragon, which then becomes a lion, and that lion a child:

> For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred Yes is needed: the spirit now wills his own will; the world's outcast now conquers his own world. Of three metamorphoses of the spirit I have told you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.-

Nietzche indicts those with "good consciences" as the sleepers who believe life has no sense to it. Having a good conscience is not enough.

>His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the most sensible nonsense for me also. Now I know well what people once sought above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought, and opiate virtues to promote it! To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no better meaning of life. Even now, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not all are so honest: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: soon they will lie
>
 >No small art is it to sleep: for its sake must one stay awake all day

On [[mind body duality]]
Believe me, my brothers! It was the body which despaired of the body- it groped with the fingers of the deluded spirit at the ultimate walls. 

>Believe me, my brothers! It was the body which despaired of the earth- it heard the bowels of being speaking to it. And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head- and not only with its head - into "the other world."

>But that "other world" is well concealed from man, that dehumanized, inhuman world which is a heavenly nothing; and the bowels of being do not speak to man, except as man.

(probably misattributed SMBC) Nietzche is all about the "the closed loops of meaning" which sidestep the conclusions of existentialism:

>I teach men a new will: to will this path which man has followed blindly, and to affirm it- and no longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and decaying! The sick and decaying- it was they who despised the body and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth! 

>... From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for them. Then they sighed: "O that there were heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!" Then they contrived for themselves their bypaths and bloody potions!

Again exhorting intrinsic motivation:

>This is my good, this I love, thus does it please me entirely, thus alone do I want the good. I do not want it as divine law, not as a human law or a human need; it will not be a guide-post for me to over-earths and paradises. It is an earthly virtue which I love: there is little prudence in it, and least of all any common wisdom. But that bird built its nest with me: therefore, I love and cherish it- now it sits with me on its golden eggs.

On criminal law

> the thought is one thing, the deed another, and the idea of the deed still another. The wheel of causality does not roll between them.

Succumbing to the weak desire for blood is what murderers do, and it should be punished.
I want to kill X, murdering X, and the idea of murdering X.

It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood
>OF ALL that is written, I love only what a man has written with his blood. Write with blood, and you will find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate reading idlers.



Noble intentions, which Nietzche sees as the best intentions possible, can become corrupted into those who see "spirit as lust":

> The noble man would create the new, and a new virtue. The good want the old, and that the old should be preserved. But it is not the danger of the noble man that he might become one of the good, but that he might become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer. Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they slandered all high hopes. Then they lived shamelessly in brief pleasures, only lived from day to day. "Spirit too is lust,"- they said. The wings of their spirit are broken; and now their spirit crawls about, and defiles what it gnaws. Once they thought of becoming heroes; now they are libertines. The idea of the hero offends and troubles them.


On irony, ironic childhood habits, and nihilism:

> They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach renunciation of life, and pass away themselves! There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of weariness and renunciation. They would rather be dead, and we should welcome their wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins! They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse- and immediately they say: "Life is refuted!" But only they are refuted, and their eye, which sees only one facet of existence. Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that bring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth. Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats while mocking their childishness: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their clinging.

Nietzche sees those who are tired of life as not worth saving: 

> Everywhere resounds the voices of those who preach death; and the earth is full of those to whom death must be preached

Very praxisy:

> You shall seek your enemy; you shall wage your war- for your thoughts! And if your thoughts perish, your honesty should still shout triumph for that! You shall love peace as a means to new wars- and the short peace more than the long. I recommend to you not work, but battle. I recommend to you not peace, but victory. Let your work be a battle, let your peace be a victory!

Let your commanding itself be an obeying (guided by unshakeable principles)

>In mockery the mischievous man and the weakling meet. But they misunderstand each other. I know you. You shall only have enemies you can hate, not enemies you despise. You must be proud of your enemy; then, the success of your enemy is also your success. Disobedience- that is the nobility of slaves. Let your nobility be obedience. Let your commanding itself be an obeying! To the good warrior "thou shalt" sounds better than "I will." And all that is dear to you, you shall first have it commanded of you.

> ==Your highest thought, however, you shall receive as a command from me- and it is this: man is something that will be overcome.==

Nietzche views the idea of the state as a lie. He sees traditional ethnic groups as the correct way of life and notes that they are confused by and despise the state:

> Where there are still peoples, the state is not understood, and is hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.

"On earth there is nothing greater than I: I am the governing hand of God."- thus roars the monster. And not only the long-eared and short-sighted fall upon their knees!


### the state

Nietzche is against what he calls the illusion of the state. The realm of the superman begins where the state ends:

> The state, I call it, where all drink poison, the good and the bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the state, where the slow suicide of all- is called "life." Behold the superfluous! They steal the works of the creators and the treasures of the wise. Education, they call their theft- and everything becomes sickness and trouble to them! Behold the superfluous! They are always sick; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour each other and cannot even digest themselves. Behold the superfluous! They acquire wealth and become the poorer for it. They seek power, and the lever of power, much money- these impotent ones! See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and thus pull each other into the mud and the abyss. They all strive for the throne: this is their madness- as if happiness sat on the throne! 

> Better to break the windows and jump into the open air! Escape from their foul stench! Escape from the idolatry of the superfluous! Escape from their foul stench! Escape from the steam of these human sacrifices! The earth is yet free for great souls. There are still many empty sites for the lonesome and the twosome, surrounded by the fragrance of tranquil seas. A free life is yet possible for great souls. 
> He who possesses little is that much less possessed: blessed be a little poverty! There, where the state ends- there only begins the man who is not superfluous: there begins the song of the necessary, the single and irreplaceable melody. There, where the state ends- look there, my brothers! Do you not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?

Nietzche finds the "companion of lessers" distasteful

> Your neighbors will always be poisonous flies; what is great in you- that itself must make them more poisonous, and always more fly-like. Flee, my friend, into your solitude- and there, where a rough strong breeze blows. It is not your lot to shoo flies

And then the overt sexism begins.

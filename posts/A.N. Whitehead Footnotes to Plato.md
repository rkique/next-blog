[[analytical philosophy]]

The renowned British philosopher A.N Whitehead once commented on Plato’s thought: 

“The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. I do not mean the systematic scheme of thought which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings. I allude to the wealth of general ideas scattered through them”.

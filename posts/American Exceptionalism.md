After the [[Soviet Bloc Collapse]], there was only one superpower left: America. It was clear that Russia needed time to recover and could not assume as prominent of a place in world politics as the USSR had. 

''Unipolarity was initially just a description of //what// was happening in the world. The U.S.A. assumed leadership, leading NATO forces in border resolutions in Serbia and the Seige of Sarajevo, and protecting Kuwait from Iraqi invasion''. Yet over time, this unipolarity developed into an //ideology// above and beyond its roots, particularly after 9/11.

!!!American Leadership
America intervened in Iraq's invasion of Kuwait --- they were the only entity to uphold the UN international law. America intervened to stop Serbian ethic cleansing after the collapse of [[Yugoslavia]] in the Dayton Accords. America would assume world leadership time and time again in providing a solution. America remained the most powerful actor in the world, and the world had become unipolar.

This idea arose in contrast to "Asian enthusiasm" which posited Japan as the Eastern replacement, and in contrast to declinists, who believed that the U.S. //already// suffered from imperial overstretch. Yet it was proven to be true. If American primacy did not constitute unipolarity in the late 1990's, nothing ever would.

!!!American dominance
The two major consequences of the post-Cold War world are continued American dominance, and rogue states with [[weapons of mass destruction]].
Today, the U.S. economy remains the largest in the world, nominally, at 22 trillion GDP. ''China has 27 trillion GDP (PPP)'': purchasing power parity is a measure of the actual value of currency.  The U.S. military is necessary to maintain U.S. supremacy. The US remains a mostly pacific and commercial republic. Yet we see their hidden military power in Kosovo, fought entirely from the air for the United States. This was to promote the independence of a largely Muslim population despite Russian objections.

!!!9/11
The U.S. was able to destroy Al-Qaeda, in a matter of weeks from a range of //7000// miles. After 9/11, when the illusion of American invulnerability was shattered, it came back with a vengeance. The economy rebounded, Congress united against terror, and the Pentagon began planning its military response. This was accompanied with an international response that brought many nations into the American camp: India, Pakistan, Russia, and China all took measures towards combating [[Islamic extremism]]. The Afgani operation was successful militarily, but not in deterring terrorist organizations from seeking a home in Afghanistan.

!!!Iraq
It was the //neo-conservatives// around George Bush Jr who believed it was the duty of the United States to make the world more democratic.
This included an invasion of Iraq, who might have been developing [[weapons of mass destruction]]. As in Afghanistan, the military invasion was successful, but the establishment of a political system of democracy was hampered by the social groups, the culture, etc. By 2008, the public support of unilateralism had eroded. The failure of the "Coalition of the Willing" to garner international support hastened the withdrawal.

Not one but a host of new doctrines have come tumbling out since September 11. First came the with-us or-against-us ultimatum to any state aid.  Any solution will have to include three elements: denying, disarming, and defending. Then, pre-emptive attack on any enemy state developing weapons of mass destruction. And now, regime change in any such state.

Nick Anstrom, who has strong connections to [[SSC & LW/@LW|lw]].
All other things equal, an observer should reason as if they are randomly selected from the set of all possible observers. 

This is intimately connected to the idea of observation selection bias, or the idea that the presence of an observer prefilters the evidence they observe.

[[Bayes Theorem]]

# self indication assumption
This is an argument that there does exist intelligent life, however it is not an extremely strong one. It is similar to pascal's wager in that it attempts to take infinitely small probabilities of infinitely great outcomes.

> if we posit only two possible universes, one with 10 human-like civilizations and one with 10 billion, SIA implies that all else being equal we should be 1 billion times more likely to live in the universe with 10 billion civilizations.

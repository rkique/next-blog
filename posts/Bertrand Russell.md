Best known for [[analytical philosophy]].

Formulated  "theory of types", against unrestricted comprehension, as a response to Russell's paradox. The paradox arises within naïve set theory by considering the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. Such a set appears to be a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. 

Russell’s paradox ultimately stems from the idea that any condition or property may be used to determine a set

"One should respect public opinion insofar as is neocessary to avoid starvation and keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny"

Bad conceptual ideas to bad actors

Bad conceptual ideas to careless actors [[Synplifier]]
Oh that's me awesome

>**Real Example:** In 1997, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) began to spread through New Zealand. It is believed by authorities that New Zealand farmers smuggled the disease into the country and released it intentionally as an animal control measure. RHD was used in Australia as a biocontrol tool, and organizations had attempted to get the New Zealand government to approve it for use. 
Weâ€™d like to reiterate that unsanctioned pest control using disease is A BAD IDEA!

...As DNA synthesis & lab automation technology improves, the bottleneck to the creation of a harmful agent is increasingly SPECIFIC knowledge & information rather than applied skill. Technical knowledge and precise implementation details have historically been a bottleneck for bioweapons programs, particularly terrorist or poorly-funded programs.

According to the constitution:
- representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among several states...
	-	including
	-  free persons
	- excluding Indians not taxed
	- 3/5 of all other persons	

- And that it should be done every 10 years.

1840 census: the number of respondents who note someone is insane is correlated to the african american population.

1790 census: name, free males above 16, free males below 16, how many females above, how many other persons, how many slaves?

## How do we count people?

Census statute:
- People should be counted who live or stay at the residence the most of the time
- Stayed there on April 1st 2010 and had no other place to stay
- People who stay there more than any other place

## Utah v Evans
Census Hot-deck imputation
It imputes a status by assuming that the unknown address has the same characteristics as the closest nearby unit.

Imputation accounted for 0.4% of the total count. North Carolina got an additional seat in Congress, and Utah found out. So the question is: is imputation lawful?

Imputation is fundamentally different from sampling, because it is attempting to predict a few gaps. Sampling every 10th book, or going through book by book and filling in the empty gaps.

*Does that make sense though? *

Actual enumeration does not require actual physical contact.
We do not decide precisely what limitations those words, actual enumeration, do impose. We conclude only that they do not bar the Census Bureauâ€™s use of imputation here where the Bureau has made an effort to reach every household where it involves a tiny percentage of the population and where the alternative would mean a less accurate count --> Where the alternative would mean a less accurate count.	

The difference is a difference in scope. "Hot Deck" imputation --> you use a set of cards that "you believe" is statistically similar to the rest of the tract. Interpolation vs extrapolation.

If you have a range of random numbers between 1 and 10, and given one (sampling), you attempt to predict the average value of the rest of those numbers, you also have an expected error of 2.5. If you have a range of random numbers between 1 and 10 and you attempt to predict the next number through imputation, you have an expected error of 2.5. 

If there is greater homogenity, the error in sampling and imputation decrease at the same rate. If we believe that houses next to each other are more likely to be similar, then we can factor that into sampling.

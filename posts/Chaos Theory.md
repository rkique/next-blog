Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization.[3] 

At the subatomic scale, quantum mechanics. At the cosmic scale, relativity.

[[The Butterfly Effect]], an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions).[4] A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in Texas can cause a hurricane in China.[5]

Chaos Theory describes [[Linearity|linear systems]], which describe 99% of reality.

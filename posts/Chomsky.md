## Chomsky linguistics UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR
The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [structural rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") are [innate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori") to humans, independent of [sensory experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_experience "Sensory experience").
Chomsky argued that the [human brain]  contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

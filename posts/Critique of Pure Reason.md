This is not Kant's [[Categorical Imperative]], which is a metaphysical attempt at morals.

To learn more about the world, we have two modes of thinking: analytical and synthetic judgements. With analytical judgements, we deduce something from solely //a priori// knowledge, which should make any analytical statement purely definitional and not very useful. With a synthetic judgement, we make a new association between an attribute and an object ("all swans are white"). However, this can only usually be proven only //a posteriori// -- by confirming all swans are white.

However, with mathematics and physics, we are able to deduce synthetic //a priori// knowledge, or universal truths:

 If our a priori knowledge is limited to definitional analytic judgments, then Hume is right in concluding that rationally justified knowledge of universal and necessary truths is impossible. Kant’s coup comes in determining that synthetic judgments can also be a priori. He shows that mathematics and scientific principles are neither analytic nor a posteriori...

The fact that we can do this means that pure reason can deduce important truths, but Kant argues this says more about ourselves than about the universe. Universal truths are more truths about our perceptions of the world than about the unknowable things-as-they-are. Kant maintains that we view everything through unremovable filters of causation and time, interpreting things *as they are* through our senses. We have no real knowledge of things *as they are*. 

This does not make metaphysics (abstract reasoning about our world) useless, however. Instead, Kant sees metaphysics as a way to understand the limitations of reason itself, the limits of what we can know.

<<<
From rationalism, he draws the idea that pure reason is capable of significant knowledge but rejects the idea that pure reason can tell us anything about things-in-themselves. From empiricism, he draws the idea that knowledge is essentially knowledge from experience but rejects the idea that we can infer no necessary and universal truths from experience, which is Hume’s conclusion. 
By locating the answers to metaphysical questions not in the external world but in a critique of human reason, Kant provides clear boundaries for metaphysical speculation and maintains a sensible, empirical approach to our knowledge of the external world.

!Criticisms

* Idealism jettisons things-in-themselves and the whole noumenal realm, arguing instead that reality consists primarily of mental phenomena. 

* The logician Gottlob Frege criticizes Kant for basing the analytic–synthetic distinction on the subject-predicate form of grammar, which is not a necessary feature of the logical structure of language or reality -- Tlon, Uqbar, Orbius Tertius

* Kant is only able to argue that geometry, for instance, relies on synthetic a priori knowledge because he fails to distinguish between pure geometry—the stuff of mathematical axioms and proofs—and empirical geometry—the application of geometrical principles to science. Pure geometry is a priori, but it is also analytic, since it is justified according to logical principles alone. Empirical geometry is synthetic, but it is also a posteriori, since we only learn from experience what sort of geometry applies to the real world.

*The concepts of a priori and a posteriori are themselves //a priori//-- perhaps there is no difference between deduction and experience.

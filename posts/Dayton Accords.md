title: Dayton Accords
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Bosnian War (1992–1995) was one of the most brutal conflicts in Europe since the end of World War II. Thirty‐four cease‐fires failed to produce peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the late American diplomat, Richard Holbrooke, brokered one that set the stage for a series of negotiations—starting in the Balkans and ending in Dayton, Ohio. The Dayton peace process finally terminated the Bosnian War. The interplay of military intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and diplomacy by the United States was remarkable.

In practice, there can be instances where biased mediators nevertheless broker for peace, as the United States did while intervening against Serbian aggression. 

* Lesson 1: Seize the moment.
After widespread American coverage of the Srebrenica massacre, NATO/UN policy changed.

* Lesson 4: Remind parties of their weak BATNAs.
“best alternative to a negotiated agreement": Holbrooke's team projected a hurting stalemate; all the adversaries could envision a scenario in which failing to enter the mediation process would hurt them more than continuing the conflict.

* Lesson 6: It is not about what is proposed, but who proposes it.
In discussions about the final map of Bosnia, the Americans could see that the proposer was more important than the proposal. They recognized that “each map drawn by the parties would be worse than its predecessor,” so they had to present their own map—“the American map”—in an attempt to move the negotiations forward (Holbrooke 1999: 270). 

* Lesson 8: Include devils if you must, exclude them if you can.
The lesson for negotiators is to exclude objectionable individuals if you can, but include them if you must. Peace negotiations inevitably involve people with blood on their hands. Nonetheless, as objectionable as some of the peace talk participants were (most notably Milošević and Tuđman),5 they were vital to the process because they held leverage over the conflict situation. This lesson was forgotten in Iraq, when the top American civilian administrator there, Paul Bremer, embarked on a policy of “de‐Ba'athification.” All public servants affiliated with Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, including between 350,000 and 400,000 soldiers, were banned from employment in the public sector (Arraf 2003). //A massive spike in insurgency resulted and experts claim that there is a strong link between “de‐Ba'athification” and the formation of the Islamic State.//

* Lesson 9: Provide flexibility to the negotiator but keep him or her in check.
Clinton was not invested in the Dayton process to the same extent as Holbrooke. He therefore did not have the same emotional attachment to it, which allowed him, if need be, to pull the United States out of the process or replace Holbrooke with another mediator.

* Lesson 10: Location, location, location
Holbrooke (2005) noted, “I had said from the beginning that I would never go to a city like Geneva, the ultimate symbol of failed diplomatic missions, a place where people are cynical, cold bureaucrats, and everything leaks to the press and to each other.” His motivation for selecting Dayton was threefold. First, Holbrooke wanted the negotiations to take place far from Europe to make it difficult for the parties to abandon the talks. Second, he wanted the parties to negotiate away from big‐city distractions so that they could focus on the important matters at hand. Third, he was adamant that the parties be isolated from the media so that they would negotiate with one another and not posture through the media. This was especially important given how much the Bosnian War was fueled by propaganda.

* Lesson 11: Be incremental and then go for gold.
The value of the initial incremental approach is threefold. First, small steps toward peace may help the parties see alternatives to war, thereby altering their BATNAs. For example, a cease‐fire—accompanied by the opening up of public transport, the removal of physical barriers (like roadblocks), and other improvements in people's lives—could create a first step in demonstrating the possibility of normalization. It could also create public expectations that leaders are serious about negotiating peace. Second, an incremental approach could help to build trust gradually; it is much easier to take small steps with a long‐time adversary, to implement basic agreements, and then to move toward a broader agreement, then it is to negotiate a comprehensive agreement at the beginning of the peace process. Third, one could lock in a number of smaller agreements and implement those despite the absence of a comprehensive peace. Although the Dayton Accords were wide ranging, the overall package was divided into many smaller agreements (U.S. Department of State 2018). The advantage was that notwithstanding a walkout by the parties or a failure to reach a grand peace agreement, the parties could begin to resolve the issues upon which they agreed, thereby closing the gap between them. If the parties subsequently engaged in further negotiations, they could pick up from where they left off and close the issues that they were unable to resolve earlier.

* Lesson 12: Credibility trumps impartiality.
Milošević needed a credible mediator who was able to end the war rather than a mediator who was neutral but weak.

* Lesson 13: Perfect is the enemy of the good.
 As the seconds ticked off to conclude the Dayton talks, the Americans reminded the Bosnians that the final agreement as drafted was as good as it would get and there simply was no other alternative. For the Bosnians, it was not merely a question of acting rationally (reason dictates that peace is preferable to war), it was an emotional matter as well. After a long silence, Izetbegović said, “[I]t is not a just peace … but my people need peace” (Holbrooke 1999: 309).

...a continuing Bosnian conflict would have led to more genocides, akin to what happened in Srebrenica, and stronger linkages between Bosniaks and radical Islamic groups. In the long term, other European players might have escalated their involvement with the conflict as Turkey and Greece—two NATO allies—were already supporting opposing sides.

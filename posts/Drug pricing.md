1. Biased article, from an "innovation thinktank", but I think they are correct in identifying the way that R&D is intrinsically supported by existing sales:
	> Selling pharmaceuticals is a global business of relatively low risk (once established in the market, best-selling drugs tend to stay that way), life-and-death demand and immense scale. Proprietary small-molecule drugs (those still under patent protection) can cost pennies to manufacture and sell for thousands to millions of patients. 
 	> On the other hand, drug discovery is a business of high and inherently unpredictable risk that consumes billions of dollars over cycle times measured in decades. Pharma excels at sales but is failing at discovery. Without profitable innovation, the industry cannot sustain itself.

2. White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) (this report actually supports both lower pricing AND increased innovation in US while pinning the loss on a global tragedy of commons:

>"Since the United States accounts for roughly half of the global market (in terms of the amount of drugs consumed), one might normally expect it to pay for about half of subsequent rounds of innovation. But many countries, including high-income ones, pursue policies that keep the prices of their patented drugs artificially low.. Because manufacturers cannot recover much of their fixed costs overseas, they must charge higher prices in the United States in order to achieve a given rate of return. (Americans pay about 70% of total)." 

For individual small wealthy countries, having price ceilings don't really affect global innovation. However, collectively, price ceilings harm innovation -- and especially price ceilings in America.

Interesting tidbit 1: less than 14% of retail pharmaceuticals are paid from out of pocket today (in US)
- (https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/NHE60-27.zip).

Interesting tidbit 2: average cost of developing and bringing to market a new compound is something like $2.6 billion (in 2013 dollars) https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/2273267066/2273267066.pdf


Here is a nice impartial source which does a review of existing literature in the "Economics of the Pharmaceutical Industry" by USC chair, no competing interests declared although he does run a healthcare consulting firm. Note that there are journals and entire fields of study dedicated to drug pricing.

Drug advertising has its benefits:
>Much debate has revolved around whether pharmaceutical advertising is informative or persuasive (Dave 2013)... In a standard monopoly framework, monopoly pricing leads to underutilization. The use of advertising mitigates this underuse and generates social value as a result... For small-molecule drugs, one might argue that utilization does not become excessive until the marginal benefit of using drugs turns negative or nearly so.
>restrictions on advertising will tend to dampen innovation by reducing post-approval profits (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2012)

We don't know if setting restrictions on advertising vs R&D works:
> Much ink has been spilled debating the information content of advertising and its relative merits versus investments in innovation... much remains unknown about the optimal configuration of public policy toward advertising."

And while we don't know if we are incentivising enough innovation (although we know that usually, such innovation is highly societally impactful vs profitwise (for example, AIDS therapies increased social welfare by est. $1.4 trillion, while companies profitted by on $63 billion)) (https://www.nber.org/papers/w12016)...

>The question of whether innovation is too high or too low is [perhaps the most important] policy question in the economics of the pharmaceutical industry... Yet, economists have not produced a definitive answer. At best, we have suggestive analyses that point to the low rate of surplus capture by innovators, and modeled estimates suggesting that the social return to innovation is positive on the margin.
>(surplus capture refers to the $ profit of pharmaceuticals as opposed to the intangible societal impact in quality of life)

We DO KNOW is that economic incentives work.
>"Pharmaceutical firms systematically respond to economic incentives when it comes to making investments in innovation, pricing, and marketing. This may not seem surprising to economists, but many influential clinicians, public health researchers, and policy analysts continue to be skeptical about the relative importance of economic incentives. For example, in a recent and widely cited piece, two highly influential oncologists argue that cutting pharmaceutical prices would have little effect on innovation, which [they claim is] motivated primarily by altruism rather than the prospect of financial reward"

finally, here is an empirical study from NBER on EU regulation showing the tradeoff between innovation and pricing
>Results show that EU consumers enjoyed much lower pharmaceutical price inflation, however, at a cost of 46 fewer new medicines introduced by EU firms and 1680 fewer EU research jobs

Even if research is directed in the direction of rich people, I'm not sure if that

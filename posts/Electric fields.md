[[Gravitational Fields]]
MAGIC

F = mg

g = N/kg

If you place a mass m in a uniform g field, it will start to accelerate in the direction of the g-field, which is down.

A uniform electric field behaves the same way as a gravitational field
Electric particles will always head towards the positive side (run to red), and DNA 

> electric field comprise of SEVERAL charges, which is independent of the test charge. It only depends on the configuration of the source charges, and once found, allows us to calculate the force on any test charge.

>the electric charge on an object alters the space around the charged object in such a way that all other electrically charged objects in space experience an electric force as a result of being in that field (a vector force)

Nothing is real (except everything is real, other than the things which try to tell you otherwise)

Aesthetic is what we chase. All of us from upper middle class backgrounds and we are flying, swarming towards MOLOCH, a great light of coffee tables and yoga and craft beers which comes at the expense of beautiful things. Big Tech, save us, give us food and shelter but more importantly meaning! We simply want a room that isn't so depressing when the ceiling light is on, we want atmosphere and adventure and excitement. No blank walls, no children's books, no grey suburbs. We want to feel like we are getting closer to this dream, so we betray our chances at truly getting there.

But does that lifestyle, that approximation of lifestyle really make you happy enough? Do Salt and Straw, pilates, Chipotle stir a fire within you? They are kind of company who have realized that they need to sell the experience.

Barren town centers open up with storefronts labeled in nameless block fonts that serve fish and chips and fro-yo and boutique soaps. And a convenience store labeled "Antique" in the same font as Claim Jumper. Old-timey & authentic, yet so ridiculously unconvincing in its charade that it is sad, accepted only because you have no other option and because it is in principle it is socially agreed upon not to point out how unbelievably shitty modern life is. Tiny apartments for rent right next door at astronomical prices.

Is this aesthetic? 

But even on the other end of the spectrum. Imagine the very best life of this kind that you could live, downtown san francisco in a beautiful city. You are offered back massages, you are catered to, well fed. You are given avocado toast and free reservations at top restaurants. You take frequent vacations to Lake Tahoe and own a tesla and a beautiful house by the waterfront. Is it better? Is it enough? Is the modern company life aesthetic enough, is it a life in perfect form enough?

Jungle, blue light, monolith. Tribal chanting around firelight. Warm chocolate, velvet, glowing butterflies. Liquid pools as far as the eye can see. Towering spindly structures, there are jetblack spaces and tokoyo railways and hadron colliders, and there are jellyfish and warm cartops and soft raindrops and liminal spaces. Aesthetics which are not consumables, which we take for granted. Which we see as the backdrop for our own transformations as fashionable and ever-present.

Twenty years from now, will you look back and be happy? There is no great capitalist struggle for most of us, predominately asian, white, middle-upper-class. What we, or at least I, really care about is meaning, and the great enemy of meaning is this great beast of the external, of consumerism and the college system and LinkedIn.

That beast wants to get you to accept a watered down version of somebody else's subculture as your ultimate calling in life.  

"The FBLA party tonight is going to be so lit." How? How can you take yourself seriously as a person? How can you be someone so different to different people, to subjugate yourself to the professional? How can you tell yourself that you don't want to chase dreams and breathe fire and stumble past the horizon? Is it because you have reserves of authenticity, secret audiences on secret tiktok accounts who you can be your true self or forums which you can frequent late at night and shed your skin, throw off the horrible persona who you need to become during the day. If you are that character on that show, don't trick yourself into thinking that change will come on its own. 

You are on a committee, you are in a club, you are the vice treasurer and perhaps even the president one day. And it matters to no one, not even yourself. 

My experience with the great beast is in constantly shifting aesthetics and the instantaneous breakdown of every trend and psuedointellectualism and many canceled meetings and paper clubs and many failed successes for every successful failure and the complete disintegration of what it means to be indie and continual selection bias and painfully artificial passions in model un biographies and templates for nonprofits (in the form of legalese), artwork (in the form of portfolio planning services), living life (in influencers) and twitter and self-promotion and politics at an ever younger age and selective high school admissions and dream lotteries and hackathons which churn out apps to fight climate change and endless network abuse for nonprofits, startups, personal brands. Then, disillusioned by the flimsiness of our dreams, we spend great amounts of money for a college-as-hedonism, to buy friends who are better than us and an environment which is more real, so we become superimposed with the movie screen. 

People don't realize we're living in the future, that for the purposes of social interaction our devices have completely changed the ways we live. Attention is infinitely valuable, and it has been captured just as effectively we imagine in some dystopian future society, no singularity or holoscreens involved. Today, culture dissolves at rapid speeds, subsumed in waves of ironic periodicity and marketing. and it has been doing so for a while. What is a subculture or aesthetic beyond a collection of products? What is the culture beyond consuming? 

Who are you beyond the image you pay to project?

Writing HTML and CSS in an open office in San Francisco thirty years after Google and Amazon and Apple, you are a HACKER, you are a ROCK STAR. You are the QUIRKY and IMPERFECT MILLENIAL, who no longer dreams at night. Whose dreams are all owned by movies and Conde Nast.

But no, you're not. You are Gen-Z. Your life is still yours.

FBLA kids who have no passion for business. Kids who convince their parents that they just need to be a little bit more social. Everyone who are getting a CS degree to make money. Suburb kids who browse the Bay Area on Google Maps and imagine a future dead in the housing-market-past.

It is not too late for new culture. Reject fake opportunities, experiences which will make you embarrassed. Challenging yourself is not stacking a resume with emptiness, it is fighting a system which exhorts you to sell every moment from your living body. Be real, be intelligent, be cynical, be naive, understand the world and fight the meaning which is simultaneously imposed and demanded from you.

For Twitter, we report clear differences in user reactions to trusted vs. deceptive sources. Deceptive (including disinformation) sources have a much higher rate of appreciation reactions and a lower rate of elaboration responses, compared to
trusted news sources. Differences are still significant (p < 0.01) but the trends reverse if we do not include disinformation sources. We also see an increase in the rate of question-reactions compared to trusted news sources if we exclude disinformation sources.

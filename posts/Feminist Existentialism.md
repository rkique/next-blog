What does chapter XI tell us about Ms. Ramsey?

... We see her drop a mask completely for the first time in the novel: "Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir". We can see that she affords Mr. Ramsey the opportunity to "protect" her from the harshness of the light (which is presumably a metaphor for life), even though he cannot do so. She is pure in her "praising of the light" and self-conscious of doing so, this action of praise itself being pure. And she finds ecstasy in the color of the light, the "waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach". 

She is fluent in social language but only as a defense against existential dread: "With her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but suffering, death, the poor". Thus this book has essentially only two "mature" visions of civilization/culture, and both are as a denial of death, “immortality projects”. (Woolf seems to define maturity as an acceptance of the true nature of life) One is the masculine quest for intellectual permanence in greatness and the other the feminine quest for permanent in impermanence (Mrs. Ramsey about the dinner scene: "Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures." and Lily about the intertwining branches of memory). Mirrors traditional archetypes of femininity as seasons/cylicity as impermanent yet impermanent & masculinity as a rock.

Thinking about Simone Weil's Gravity and Grace & this tribute book called Aliens and Anorexia which I read over the summer, the influences of Mrs. Ramsey on Simone Weil & feminist existentialism (?) are super clear: 

"she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and looking, with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at--that light, for example." 

The idea of a kind of radical empathy, of truly becoming another, having the strength to bear all of human suffering and acknowledge it, and then fix it as Mrs. Ramsey does, matchmaker and homemaker, is extraordinary. Hearth vs the outside world metaphor, we see Ms. Ramsey parallel internally Mr. Ramsey's external yet solipsistic quest for "greatness". 

++ Woolf subverts the physical dominance of masculinity as revealing deep insecurities, which require female acquiescence: "For he wished, she knew, to protect her." And see Lily re Tansley later on.

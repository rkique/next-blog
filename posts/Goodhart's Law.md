Any observed statistical regularity (aka correlations) will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes. 


Here are some ways that a proxy fails to match a target correctly.

Regressional: when selecting for the proxy within a sample (basketball players), you also unsuspectingly selecting for differences between the proxy and the goal (tall players within basketball players are better. random tall players are not necessarily).

Causal: two measures correlated to a third thing.

Extremal: when the proxy takes an extreme value it's an outlier.

Adversarial: true goodhart

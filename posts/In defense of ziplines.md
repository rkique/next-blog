1. ziplines? super fuckin hard to maintain.

Not more than regular road infrastructure or power lines. Power lines are the clearest and nearest public system -- great risk if they fail, **and they don't really fail.**


5. how do you connect to the zipline? do you wear a harness everywhere?

Trivial implementation details

7. are you supposed to climb up a platform to use the zipline? how?

You only need to go above the maximum truck height which is around 20-25 feet. You can climb or take stairs

9. how many people can use these ziplines

Enough to justify their construction

11. system for sending zipline back and forth?

Powered zipline. or just do the playground insert

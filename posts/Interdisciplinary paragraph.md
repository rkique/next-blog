[[College RESULTS]]

I am fascinated by the interdisciplinary. I am an impatient optimist, long-distance curious, and a speck on an infinitesimal slice of a beautiful planet. I am a student, an artist, a hacker and a scientist; and I want to spend my life chasing horizons.

I am fascinated by the interdisciplinary frontiers of the recently possible, gems of conceptual beauty arising from computer science, design, biology, and contemporary art. I am at once a student, an artist, a hacker and a scientist: and I want to chase horizons for the rest of my life.

: Addresses the automatic detection of sarcasm and irony by introducing an ensemble approach based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), that takes into account several classifiers according to their reliabilities and their marginal probability predictions. 

Results show that not all the features are equally able to characterise sarcasm and irony, whereby sarcasm is better characterised by Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, and ironic statements by pragmatic particles (such as emoticons and emphatic/onomatopoeic expressions, which represent those linguistic elements typically used in social media to convey a particular message).

The authors found out “that a humorous tweet is 76.7% likely to also be sarcastic”, whereas “sarcastic tweets are only 26.2% likely to be humorous”. Future work is required on the connection between sarcasm and humour.

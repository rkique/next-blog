Key idea: ∇F, on function, and ∇G, on constraint, are both perpendicular to the level curve G that (we so choose to use to) define a constraint.

now, the candidates for extrema of F when constrained to a curve S are found by finding (x,y)(x,y) such that	

∇F(x,y) =λ⋅∇G(x,y)∇F(x,y) =λ⋅∇G(x,y)

since (x,y)(x,y) that satisfy this equation are those where the gradient vectors of FF are perpendicular to the level curve G(x,y)\=cG(x,y)\=c.

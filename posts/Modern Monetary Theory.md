"The most important conclusion reached by MMT is that the issuer of a currency faces no financial constraints. Put simply, a country that issues its own currency can never run out and can never become insolvent in its own currency. There is no default risk on government debt."

## objections

1. any money government prints end up as reserves, and the Fed will have to pay interest on these reserves. The money can stay as reserves forever, but interest accrues over time.
2. I agree that the government can always print money to pay bills. But that fact does not free the government from its intertemporal budget constraint. 
3. I agree that the economy normally operates with excess capacity, in the sense that the economy's output often falls short of its optimum. But that conclusion does not mean that policymakers only rarely need to worry about inflationary pressures. 
4. I agree that, in a world of pervasive market power, government price setting might improve private price setting as a matter of economic theory. But that deduction does not imply that actual governments in actual economies can increase welfare by inserting themselves extensively in the price-setting process.

My career as a homing missile.

There exist many systems in which the perspectives of those of the purpose of their being there must fundamentally change from the bottom to the top.

For one, academia.

This is getting also into what I was writing about superficial signifiers of the profound, but leads to what might be a more interesting conclusion: many specialized career paths are necessarily nonlinear. 

The classic examples include modern mathematics. As many people have stated , what I'm learning in high school and before will have almost nothing to do with the core of modern mathematics, which is a lot more proofs and abstraction. Even from undergrad mathematics to graduate math, most if not all of the theory is not even in textbooks but embedded within universities and anecdotes (can't find the quote, something about lean).

Is the beauty of multiplication the same as the beauty of [insert mathematical term here]? blah blah blah I'm not sure what I'm getting at now. Maybe that the beauty & interesting aspects of a profession needs to be evenly distributed/consistent for a linear progression.

On academia and specialization: there are quite a few professions where you only realize the heart of what is important to you much much deeper in. 

Only an artist understands what the true work of the artist is like. Very few people who make art make it just because they are passionate about art as a whole. Only an artist understands what making their own work is like, and they have no knowledge of what the journey which they will embark on (and its intellectual fruits) will necessarily entail up until that point.

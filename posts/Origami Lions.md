Currently we have confirmed 641 lions at the school.

This means that we will need 859 more lions over the course of final semester (which is 18 weeks). This means we need about 47 lions per week.

update: this was finished on June 8th with the participation of our entire advisory! We ended up with 1,549 lions which we placed on the floor of the lakeside gym and carefully documented.

[[qPCR]]

PCR is the amplification of a DNA or cDNA template by factors of thousands or millions. It was first developed in the 1980s.

A typical PCR reaction includes
- template DNA
- DNA polymerase, such as Taq or Bst (1.25 units per 50ul amplification)
- two primers (see [[Primer Design]])
- dNTPs [^1] (0.2 mM)
- buffer
- magnesium [^2] (1.5 mM for 50 ul Taq)

Once assembled, the reaction is put in a thermal cycler and shifted through different temperatures, simulating heat shock of a plasmid.


The stages are 

1. Denaturing (high temperature): DNA split
2. Anneal (lower temperature): polymerase bind
3. Extend (high temperature): polymerase activation

Hot Start reduces non-specific amplificaiton.

The limit for single polymerase PCR is about 5kb, otherwise too many truncated products will prevent further amplification. This can be sidestepped through using a proofreading polymerase as followup.

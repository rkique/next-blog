[[problems with polling]]
Polling is a way to read the landscape. It helps governments make decisions. It can help predict the future. Its predictions can influence the future results. The fact that polling is occuring affects the poll-takers.

Polling can reinforce peer pressure, but it is really only a reflection of the popular opinion. Ideally, we would know every other person's stance on every issue before we took our own stance, but obviously that's difficult.

The 2010 census cost 13 billion dollars. 

We don't know the world's population to any degree of accuracy

A poll only gets 1 sample! Samples tend to lie on a binomial distribution.
Margin of error is 1/sqrt(n), or about 3% for a sample size of 1000.

**Surveys are attempting to get ALL responses.**

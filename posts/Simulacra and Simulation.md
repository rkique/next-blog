[[lw]] Map and Territory



>If once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the cartographers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up covering the territory exactly \[...\] this fable has now come full circle for us, and possesses nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacrum \[...\] It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges persist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. The desert of the real itself.

Self-fulfilling prophecies
>Referring to "On Exactitude in Science", he argued that just as for contemporary society the simulated copy had superseded the original object, so, too, the map had come to precede the geographic territory

>the image of war preceded real war. War comes not when it is made by sovereign against sovereign (not when killing for attritive and strategic neutralisation purposes is authorised; nor even, properly spoken, when shots are fired); rather, war comes when society is generally convinced that it is coming.

Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map

Korzybski: "the map is not the territory" *Science and Sanity*
>A map _is not_ the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a _similar structure_ to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.

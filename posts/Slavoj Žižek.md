"A Marxist and Lacanian analysis of the ideological and political responses to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, "

refers to [[Simulacra and Simulation|desert of the real]] 

Žižek shows how today the fundamentalist terrorist plays an analogous symbolic role to the Jew during the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust"), the excluded "other" whose alien presence legitimizes measures of internal discipline. Although Americans were victims, so were the attacking terrorists, and therefore neither side was justified in their violent actions.

Reality as the ultimate effect:

For Žižek, this represents a prime example of the 20th-century's "passion for the Real," for which the terrorist attacks of 9/11 were the ultimate artistic expression. His argument is that because this passion was sublimated into the postmodern "passion for the semblance," Americans experienced the "return of the Real" in exactly the same way as Neo did in the film, i.e., as a nightmarish virtual landscape or "reality as the ultimate 'effect.'"

[[Situationist|social spectacle]]

In fact, the attacks were already [libidinally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido "Libido") invested by a series of Hollywood catastrophe films, showing that it was exactly what Americans secretly wanted, i.e., **their ultimate spectacular experience**. The false perception of a purely external threat allowed the system of global capitalism to go essentially unchallenged, functioning to indefinitely defer discussion about alternative socioeconomic futures.

>**Because the democratic system is always generating new states of emergency to justify the negation of its ethical principles**, the future of emancipatory politics cannot be contained within a liberal democratic framework (including notions of human rights, the rule of law, and constitutionality).
	> As ethical acts such as Israeli "peacenik" soldiers' solidarity with their Palestinian neighbors show, there are other alternatives to capitalism than fundamentalism or fascism; however, the current paradigm of the "end of history" and the "clash of civilizations" restricts the range of apparent conflicts to cultural or ethnic/religious ones, 
	> masking anything more fundamental, such as an economic conflict. The same displacement of socio-economic conflict that occurred under fascism is mirrored in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the "symptomal knot" of all the economic and cultural logics of the contemporary world.

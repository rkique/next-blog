See [[Soviet Bloc Collapse]].

By the 1970's the Soviet Union had become industrialized and urbanized. However, the [[Authoritarian government]] and the [[public economy]] had become an impediment, unable to cater to the freedom of expression that the urbanized society wanted. The [[broken systems]] lacked [[incentive]] for the working class to work harder.

1973 OPEC oil embargo on Western nations caused oil prices to soar. 
The oil price went from $2.5 in 1973, to $39 in 1979.
The Soviet Union took advantage of this and was able to finance its increasingly inefficient economy. 
However, in 1981, the Iran-Iraq war created a need for money, dumping tons of oil into the market and destroying the Soviet Union's oil exploit.

Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985, and the younger generation wanted to reform the system but due to the above, they couldn't get funds from oil. The only solution now was 'to establish better relations with the West and stopped competing in the arms race. Additionally -- Gorbachev was the first leader to grow up under the Communist regime.' And education when Gorbachev entered office was higher â€“ there was a core of well-educated professionals with knowledge of the outside world. Economic growth was slowing, and alcoholism was rising.

 Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, both members of the right, moved to destroy communism. They increased armaments through initiatives like Star Wars, and provided support for both Iran and Iraq LMAO so they would keep dumping oil into the market. 

On Gorbachev's end, he implements:

#Glasnost: political openness and greater freedom of expression to analyze societal problems.
#Perestroika: reduced the influence of central planning on production, so individual units of production could be more efficient.

1987 in Berlin >> Peaceful relations could resume once he could "tear down that wall".
Response in 1988 >> we will no longer interfere with the individual paths of allies to socialism, seeking to pursue self-reliance ("I did it my way at least").

This, predictably, led to the [[Soviet Bloc Collapse]] in 1989, the year of miracles and [[Russia]]. In 1990, with the attack of Kuwait by Hussein, Herbert Bush would state that the New World Order begun-- one marked by [[American exceptionalism]].

!!Russia remains a failed democracy
The (post collapse of USSR) Russian attempt at radical economic reform largely failed, because of extraordinary rent-seeking by old enterprise managers through export rents, subsidized credits, import subsidies and direct government subsidies, while they gained little from privatization. The reason why the managers were so strong was that the Soviet Union left large economic distortions behind and a virtually unconstrained economic elite.

Russia's transformation was slow and partial. A few people got VERY RICH on the partial reforms, and they have bought a lot of political power, preventing further economic reform.

!!Putin comes to power

Quickly moved to end the process of decentralization and prevented republics from negotiating for independence. He advocated for the state control of privatized oil and gas once more. Russia then moved to improve its relationships in the East (becoming a part of the Shanghai cooperation organization) and becoming an Asian state as well as an European one. He took a much more severe military posture with regards to South Ossetia in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and putting a brutal end to the Chechen civil war. They can also hold Ukraine, a particularly vital seaport and ethnic Russian base, hostage by cutting gas exports.

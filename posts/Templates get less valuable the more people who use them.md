Templates which increase in price as more people buy them


This reminds me of this ethics book written by a cs guy who talks about how the categorical imperative is rationally justified because hypothetical situations end up being symmetrical, so treating others how you want to be treated ends up benefitting you in the long run


1. in order to reasonably judge someone for their choices they must possess a certain base level of knowledge of the factors underlying the complex systems they are interacting with, otherwise their choices cannot be properly rational 


2. the reason most people are in this situation is that acquiring the necessary knowledge is incredibly difficult 

4. lacking this knowledge, and the resources to invest safely in a variety of areas people will then take risks, so it is not inherently a poor strategy 

6.  the people who do possess the necessary knowledge are generally already wealthy and are able to invest safely by splitting their bets or invest riskily and gain huge payoffs or cushion their losses 

8. 5. knowing all of this, it becomes clear that compassion rather than blame is a more reasonable response to poor peoples' economic situations, and better serves the goal of providing more education and resources for class mobility, especially when looking at the reasons for the success of already wealthy people

[[Media and Culture]]

McLuhan uses the term 'message' to signify content and character. The content of the medium is a message that can be easily grasped and the character of the medium is another message which can be easily overlooked. McLuhan says "Indeed, it is only too typical that the 'content' of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium". For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message#cite_note-4) Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure".[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message#cite_note-page-12-5)

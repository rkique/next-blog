[[Electoral Systems Comparison]]
What electoral system best captures the will of the American people?

It is not the national popular vote. It is absurd to think that the largest group simply by plurality holds special significance over the whole, that a president elected by the Haare count + 1 speaks for the country as a whole. America cannot be reduced to the tyranny of a racial, religious, or ideological plurality: it is a society that we all inhabit and choose to build. To elect a president requires taking a cross-section of the American public: diverse states, people from different communities within our shared America. The true will of the people is one that prioritizes diversity.

To this end, congressional districting or the current electoral system are oligarchic. Both focus on a very small portion of the population. In the Electoral college, approximately 14% of people live in a swing state. In Congressional districting, approximately 7% of people would live in a swing district. 
 
With Whole Number Proportional,  ==twenty five== of the current fifty states would be competitive, half of the nation. These are states across the board: California... These swing states would also change from election cycle to election cycle, making sure that no state is completely disregarded in presidential elections (as most states are under current EC). This would make the electoral system represent a far more accurate slice of the american population than any other system. 

Competitiveness is fundamental to civic participation. Our system will make more states competitive and increase turnout in currently non-competitive states.

Like the Electoral College, this system will preserve the number of electoral votes each state has, counterbalancing the overwhelming power that urban areas would have in a popular vote system.

Additionally, our system would eliminate the large amount of strategic voting present in our current winner-takes-all system. People will be more inclined to vote for the candidate they actually support, rather than voting for the most potent opponent of their least favorite candidate. Not only would more votes go to third parties, but this would increase voter turnout. 

While we can’t fix the inherent polarization, we can at least make sure that the American electoral systems are fair and representative.

Finally, our system can be quickly and easily implemented-- it would not require very much reworking on the constitution. Attempts to completely abolish the electoral system don’t have enough support and will easily be struck down. Although the Constitution institutes the Electoral College, it does not specify how the electors for each state will be chosen. In our system, each state will elect electors according to their popular vote for president, thus keeping in line with the Constitution and state soveignty.

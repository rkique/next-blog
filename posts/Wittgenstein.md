Logical positivist.

Considered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century, Ludwig Wittgenstein played a central, if controversial, role in 20th-century [[analytical philosophy]]. He continues to influence current philosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language, perception and intention, ethics and religion, aesthetics and culture. 

*Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus*
"The whole sense of the book might be summed up the following words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence"

 ==Facts do not objectively exist. ==

They require observation and a degree of context omission. Thus, they require trust in the one omitting the context.

>Without questioning the veracity of observations, if we distrust the context omitter or disagree with their omission decisions, an infinite vista of justifiable debate opens before us.

The future of humanity does depend on persuading people to be rational. And in the same way nobody cares who first spotted the Titanic’s fateful iceberg, nobody will care who “was right about the facts” if we all end up underwater.

“Being right about the facts” in 2020 is merely a fashion statement — like wearing a mink coat on the Titanic. Who gives a fuck? Steer the god-damned ship.

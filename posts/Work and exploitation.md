We live in a knowledge economy. the jobs that you and I will do differ vastly from factory and manual labor). Working long hours will not kill you the same way coal dust or asbestos will, only a failure of endurance and repetitive mental stress. A single hundred hour work week is not going to have long lasting adverse effects. 

Attention is our scarcest resource, exploitation is not our default. As luca says If you stay on a job it is because you love the work you're doing and prefer it to any alternative. You *allow* it to consume your every waking hour. If you can only imagine that as exploitation you need to become aware of your fundamental agency.

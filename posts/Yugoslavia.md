Born after WWII on principles of unity and brotherhood, and led by Josip Broz Tito, a Croatian, Yugoslavia was a socialist republic that consisted of six republicsâ€”BiH, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Yugoslavia had a lot of different ethnic identities, most importantly:'' Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, and Bosniaks.''

Tito in Yugoslavia saw that political unity, and balanced subgroups were essential for democracy. Tito made the smart decision of carving the dominant Serb population into two groups: the Bosnians and the Croatian Serbs. A larger "sense of belonging", found in the greater proletarian interests, could supersede even national identity. Consequently, there was also an appropriate balance of Federal and local autonomy. This is reminiscent of the [[European Union]], another supranational collection of states. 

Yet once Tito died and a transition to collective presidency occurred (a system where the leaders of individual republics would rotate as president of Yugoslavia) everything collapsed. This led to a lack of central authority. Combined with the inefficiencies of socialism and pressure from outside European forces, this would lead to its dissolution.

!!What happened
By 1992, the Socialist Federation of Yugoslavia had fallen apart with Croat and Slovene independence (with nationalist leaders on both sides like Slobodan Milosevic).
The two nations dependent on the Yugoslavian multiethnic makeup -- Macedonia and Bosnia -- were in trouble. Macedonia was able to declare independence with the support of UN tripwire forces. Bosnia, on the other hand, was caught between two nationalist leaders -- Serbian and Croatian ones. They decided to carve up Bosnia-Herzegovina between the two of them, though nationalist wings on both sides within Bosnia (most prominently in Sarajevo) foguth. This led to the Bosnian war, bloodiest civil war since WWII (!). The Bosnian Serbs and Croatians, carving into Bosnia Herzegovina, committed atrocities, including ethnic cleansing, executions, and massacres. The majority of victims were Slavic Muslims. 

!! No solution
European diplomacy led to a ''UN Arms Embargo'', which worked to the Serbian advantage who had guns already (//to be neutral is to be on the side of the oppressor//). The UN protection forces could not protect victims against Serbian atrocity. This was horribly illustrated in the town of Srebrenica, a supposed UN safe haven protected by Dutch peacekeepers. Serbian forces took control and massacred more than 8000 Bosnian Muslim men.

By July 1995, the war had killed more than 250,000 people, mostly Bosnian Muslims. More than 1.5 million were displaced. 

!! US intervention
Supported by France and Turkey, the US lifted the heavy arms embargo on the Bosnians, and used NATO air power to strike at the Serbians on the ground. Most importantly, they convinced the Croatian Catholics and the Bosniaks to form an alliance to tilt the numerical balance against the Serbs (they provided training and supplies). This group backed a vision of BiH as a multicultural and liberal place.

This is an example of [[American exceptionalism]], as the only power who was able to mediate peace. The [[Dayton Accords]], led by the US, created a federalized Bosnia with a Serbian and a Bosnian-Croat State. In the end, the parties agreed on the framework that created a bi-entity Bosnia: the Muslim-Croat Federation kept 51% of the territory and Republica Srpska kept 49%. A NATO-led UN-mandated peacekeeping force of 30.000 troops, the IFOR would guarantee the enforcement of the agreement.

This was successful, but yet today the Serbian, Croatian, and Muslim factions are still tenuously connected by the weakest of central governments.

TLDR: No high school student has created novel cancer treatments, despite multiple claims to the contrary.

### impressive...
"Arjun looked into the use of a new antibiotic (17-AAG) to defeat cancer’s defence."

Photothermal therapy involves injecting a patient with gold nanoparticles. These particles are useful because they accumulate in tumours, forming “nano-bullets” that can be heated to kill cancer. However, one problem with photothermal therapy is cancer cells fighting back, producing heat-shock proteins to protect themselves. The antibiotic 17-AAG can prevent those cells from doing so.

Two quotes: 

> “Proof-of-concepts were developed and tested in order to demonstrate the viability of PTT [photothermal therapy],” says Arjun. “Moreover, after analyzing the literature [reading papers] a mathematical model was developed to evaluate a theoretical synergetic treatment.” 
> Arjun’s research, which a panel of expert judges led by Dr. Luis Barreto called “world class Masters or PhD-level quality,” also won a special $1,000 prize awarded to the project with the greatest commercial potential.

### but not original
Similar research was published by ASU researchers two years earlier in 2011, as "Synergistic administration of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559185/. (synergistic here means that it combines photothermal therapy (gold nanoparticles), and chemotherapy (17-AAG)):

> The heat-shock protein (HSP) 90 inhibitor 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in clinical trials for different malignancies, including for (hyperthermia + 17-AAG).

At that time, there were already clinical trials for the theoretical synergetic treatment Arjun outlines above. Without seeing the project itself, it is hard to evaluate the work done, but it appears there is significant hyperbole in the way the media has framed Arjun's work. 17-AAG in cancer therapy is not new, and Arjun did not actually test 17-AAG, but only model its effects on photothermal therapy. Moreover, his project was done under significant mentorship at the Nanoscience Labs at the University of Calgary. Dr. Cramb, Dr. Simon Trudel and Lab Manager, Amy Tekrony provided access and all important mentorship. Over course of two years.

### This is impressive work...
Her project is called Design of Image-guided, Photo-thermal Controlled Drug Releasing Multifunctional Nanosystem for the Treatment of Cancer Stem Cells. She won the Siemens grand prize (100k). In 2009, she observed lab meetings and work at a radiology lab under Zhen Cheng, a professor at Stanford who specializes in nanoparticles. In 2010 and 2011, she did internships where she learned to make nanoparticles (known methods).

She designed a novel nanosystem for cancer stem cell treatment, which utilizes a gold and iron-oxide based nanoparticle to target only tumors in photothermal therapy. It releases drugs, allows for imaging, and monitors the site. Zhang tested this system in mice and it worked successfully, eliminating almost all malignant tumors.

### but not a cancer cure
There have been no clinical trials of her treatment beyond mice. 
There was a lot of similar work being done at that time:
overview of nanoparticle treatments (2012): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724376/
Hybrid gold-iron oxide nanoparticles as a multifunctional platform for biomedical application (June 2012 around the same time as her work):

> The data highlights the potential of these HNPs as dual function MRI contrast agents and nano-heaters for therapies such as cellular hyperthermia or thermo-responsive drug delivery.

(the uses which Zhang mentions)

https://jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-3155-10-27

Hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles were invented in 2005.

Her mentor does not comment on her project, but instead:
> “She’s at quite a high level of research,” said Cheng. “It’s not easy for a high school student.”
 
### note on photothermal therapy
For these first two examples, articles focus on photothermal therapy because it seems cool: use nanoparticles to highlight cancer cells, then shine an infrared light on them to remove them. However, using imaging and contrast agents for monitoring drug delivery has already been a part of clinical intervention for a long, long time. In the last ten years, nanomedicine has focused almost exclusively on nanoparticle tech for cancer. That tech, in turn, has focused almost exclusively on gold and iron oxide nanoparticles and their use in photothermal therapy. (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4960239). 


### Maryland high school student wins $75,000 for science fair project on pancreatic cancer diagnosis

High school student Jack Andraka won $75,000 and national science prizes for successfully detecting mesothelin through dipstick assays, an existing method for inexpensive protein detection.

A disclaimer from Pancreatic Cancer Action Network:

> The studies Jack performed show that the test he developed for the protein he is interested in, called mesothelin, is a good, reliable assay that detects very low levels of the protein in the bloodstream of mice.
>We do not yet know how much mesothelin is circulating in the bloodstream of patients whose disease is caught early enough to be eligible for surgery, or those with pre-cancer. Many promising biomarkers have worked in the case of cancer where levels are high, but have subsequently failed in tests that aim for early detection. This is because the levels of the marker are generally much lower in patients with small, early lesions compared to levels in the patients with more advanced disease that make up the test population.

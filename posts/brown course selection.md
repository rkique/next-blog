Possible concentrations

## computational biology
The most impactful major, learn about genetics and statistical inference and so forth. small CS requirement, lots of statistics 
	- took Calculus, must take Biology Intro (did not take AP biology)
	- GENETICS & Biochemistry
	- Equilibrium, Rate, Structure or Organic Chemistry
	- CS: OOP course, algorithms course
	- Probability
	- CompMolBio. The course demonstrates how to model biological problems in terms of computer science.
	- Inference in Genetics. High dimension analysis: Bayesian inferences; estimation; hypothesis testing and false discovery rates; statistical decision theory; change point algorithm; hidden Markov models; Kalman filters; and significances in high dimensions.
	- then take 2 electives from: Foundations of CompBio, Population genetics, human population genetics, machine learning, computational probability, stat inf 2
	- and take 3 from: stat inf 2, computational probability, AI, Applied math or applied PDEs
	- and take 3 from: population genetics, Foundations of CompBio, Statistical methods in bioinformatics, qmbs, human population genetics

## science technology and society
Interesting -- maybe overly rhetorical?

2 required STS courses
3 "thematic track" courses: History & Philosophy of Science, Policy & the rhetoric of science, Environment and society, independent focus?
4 science courses
3 STS theory courses in humanities

RISD
GRAPH-3280 OPEN RE/SEARCH (3 Credits) 
DM-2000 AMBIENT INTERFACES (3 Credits)
Open source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with the fundamentals of electronic circuitry. Emphasis is given to the development of creative projects (individual or collaborative), followed by an iterative implementation process (planning, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining). 
DM-2005 SEEING-MACHINES (Google Street View) (3 Credits)
CTC-2039 IMMER-SPACE (Audio immersive spaces) (3 Credits)
...based on conceptualizations such as "Relational Architecture" by Lozano-Hemmer and the "Poetics of Augmented Space" by Lev Manovich, we will learn to leverage interactive and audiovisual elements in order to design spatial experiences that are media-rich, relational, and responsive. We will use software, video-projectors, sensors and VR equipment, and explore emergent techniques including video-mapping, computer vision and augmented reality.

"The technology that powers the 2020 campaigns, explained"
MITTechReview

>Campaigns and elections have always been about data—underneath the empathetic promises to fix _your_ problems and fight for _your_ family, it’s a business of metrics.

... Hillary Clinton blamed her loss, in part, on the DNC's out-of-date data.
==most voter sets probably have between 500 to 2500 data points per person==.

## data collection
> Republicans have used Data Trust since 2013—it’s a one-stop shop that includes an exchange, voter data, and data hosting services. _Democrats initially felt this was a violation of Federal Election Commission rules against cooperation between different types of political organizations, such as PACs, nonprofits, and the campaigns themselves. The American Democracy Legal Fund, a democratic group, sued DataTrust and lost ..._ so naturally Democrats spun up their own version. That’s the Democratic Data Exchange that went live in June.

The DDX shares information between local canvassing groups, state parties, and issue oriented PACs who are Democratic.

## microtargeting
- Facebook lets campaigns target small groups and individuals.
> for example, from July 30 to August 4, an ad splashed with the message “Our Recovery Will Be Made in America” appeared in the feeds of about 2,500 Facebook users in Wisconsin.
- Google and Twitter have banned political microtargeting.

## AI modeling
[[Bayes Theorem|bayesian]] models: Instead of relying on intermittent benchmarking of the populace, models are now run using continuously updated data sets. The most common technique campaigns use is called scoring, where a group of voters get assigned a number from 1 to 100 based on how likely they are to do something or hold a certain opinion.




Personalized messaging means that each person’s view of a campaign differs, because each is taking in a different information stream...

The technologies being fervently employed right now are enabling a reality in which campaigns can manufacture cleavages in the public, fundamentally altering how we form opinions and, ultimately, vote.

There are two bills scheduled for 2021 which address targeting in social media.

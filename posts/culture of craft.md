Operating over generations, cumulative cultural evolution can generate increasingly sophisticated technologies, complex languages, psychologically-potent rituals, effective institutions, and intricate protocols for making tools, houses, weapons, and watercraft. ==This can, and often does, happen without anyone understanding how or why practices, beliefs, and protocols work, or even that these cultural elements “do” anything.== In fact, in some cases, cultural products operate more effectively when people don’t understand how or why they work, as will become clear when I discuss rituals and religions.9

Rational dissection is untenable for complex "cultural" products which have high-importances (perhaps code bases or infrastructure), culture must be trusted.

## making a deadly arrow poison (Congo Basin hunter gatherers)

>The recipe combines 10 different plant varieties, including three powerful poisons—nightshade, poison rope, and sassy bark. Poison rope alone can bring down a hippo in 20 minutes. These ingredients are first thickened with fig latex and yam juice. Saliva is then stirred in until the mixture turns brownish red. Then, a marsh toad is added, presumably for its toxic skin. This concoction is brought to a boil before crushed beetle grubs and stinging ants are blended in. The resulting dark paste is set into a bark envelope, which is then placed inside the body of a dead monkey and buried for several days. Once it is unearthed, sap from the euphorbia tree is added to this deadly adhesive paste, which can then be applied to arrows.10 Do NOT try this at home.

If you are a young learner, or a new arrival like Buckley, are you going to modify this protocol? Which plant, insect, amphibian, or processing step are you going to drop or change? Can you drop the monkey burial?


> When transmission patterns like these are placed into cultural evolutionary computer simulations, or carefully manipulated in experiments with real people trying to learn new things, the results reveal how cultural evolution can assemble highly adaptive and complex recipes, procedures, and tools over generations without anyone understanding how or why various elements are included.

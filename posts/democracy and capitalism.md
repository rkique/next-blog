There is a positive relationship between rapid and successful democratization attended by a lively civil society and successful market reform, as seen in [[Eastern Europe]] during the [[Soviet Bloc Collapse]]. It is unclear the direction in which this goes.

Democracy and capitalism are both [[incentive]] based systems rooted in an assumption of rational actors acting in their own self-interests. Religions formed on unconventional "[[broken systems]]s" (for example, radical Islam), foreign interference, and Alex-Jones style conspiracy theory all serve to undermine rational and self-serving premises. This is an example of [[competitor-tribe empathy]].

In Eastern Europe following the Soviet Bloc Transit, this was the establishment of democracy that began in 1990. As a general rule, slower gradualist approaches devolved into crony capitalism while [[Shock Therapy]] was successful.

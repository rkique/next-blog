Kant and his rational "Categorical Imperative" set the bar for deontological beliefs. 

!!The Categorical Imperative
The Golden Rule -- An action is moral only if it embodies a maxim that we could will to be a universal law. Everyone is the author and subject of universal law. This is the core deontological concept, living according to rules and motive first. The deontological argument against consequentialism is that because we can only control our own motives and //not// the consequences of our motives, that an ethics based in consequences is not based in free will.

!!! an postmodern critique
Kant is insensitive to the variety of human experience and a single moral standard cannot apply to peoples and cultures who you have no understanding of. A Kantian response would be that Kant ethics are based in a shared rationality assumed of all humans. Beneath our practical values, as rational humans we are going to (agree on rules?), which is not very convincing to me.

We work in lumps of time largely defined by the minute and the hour. What if the basic unit we use to measure things was longer? Could this be the key to being more productive?

Something I will try this monday: converting the 24 hour day into 180 8-minute intervals. 

The reason for choosing 8 minute intervals is 

1) because it is just about the length of time that you can get something like this written, and a lower bound for getting into deep work
2) because 8 is not an immediately obvious divisor and will prevent reflexive conversion back into normal-time units.

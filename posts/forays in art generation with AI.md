Read [this piece](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/clip-art/) which inspired me.
Some of the examples there:
“The Yellow Smoke That Rubs Its Muzzle On The Window-Panes”

"Dancing in the moonlight"

This one is particularly impressive: "At the end of everything, crumbling buildings and a weapon to pierce the sky"

I haven't touched AI art generation in a while and it's come really far with CLIP and DALL-E, which is exciting. What I worry about is the way it reinforces the cyclical nature of fashion, regurgitates previous (through prompt programming, the transition from physically making art to a curation based search activity) are only interesting/forceful if they're evocative of past artistic movements. So no new content is really being made. 

In some ways, this is a somewhat reactionary criticism-- the synthesis of different styles can obviously be used to create new and interesting art, and a lot of the work I've seen on r/bigsleep IS impressive, not only technically but standalone.  Yet at the moment maybe it restricts AI art to being a style not a paradigm. The problem and distinction between this development and the emergence of low art against high art is that AI is informed only by the stylistic preferences of the snapshot of the past. But then again, so are people. We'll see.

I love that it makes art, or at least image-making, so conceptual though. It's all about what ideas you can come up with and express in text, and not about the execution. I'm going to play around with this [VQGAN+CLIP](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L8oL-vLJXVcRzCFbPwOoMkPKJ8-aYdPN#scrollTo=wSfISAhyPmyp) notebook this weekend.

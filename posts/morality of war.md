# jus ad bellum

Traditional just war theory construes jus ad bellum and jus in bello as sets of principles, satisfying which is necessary and sufficient for a war’s being permissible. Jus ad bellum typically comprises the following six principles:

1.  Just Cause: the war is an attempt to avert the right kind of injury.
2.  Legitimate Authority: the war is fought by an entity that has the authority to fight such wars.
3.  Right Intention: that entity intends to achieve the just cause, rather than using it as an excuse to achieve some wrongful end.
4.  Reasonable Prospects of Success: the war is sufficiently likely to achieve its aims.
5.  Proportionality: the morally weighted goods achieved by the war outweigh the morally weighted bads that it will cause.
6.  Last Resort (Necessity): there is no other less harmful way to achieve the just cause.

Only proportionality and last resort are truly necessary .

## Morality of violent actions is all in hypotheticals;

if someone threatens my life, then killing her would be proportionate; but if I could stop her by knocking her out, then killing her would be unnecessary, and so impermissible.


[[utilitarianism]] [[consequentialism]] [[deontology]]

Necessity and proportionality judgements involve weighing harms inflicted and threats averted, indeed all relevant goods and bads. The simplest way to proceed would be to aggregate the harms to individual people on each side, and call the act proportionate just in case it averts more harm than it causes, and necessary just in case no alternative involves less harm. 

But few deontologists, and indeed few non-philosophers, think in this naively aggregative way. Instead we should weight harms (etc.) according to factors such as whether *the agent is directly responsible for them*, and whether they are intended or merely foreseen. Many also think that we can, perhaps even must, give greater importance in our deliberations to our loved ones (for example) than to those tied to us only by the common bonds of humanity. 

This is in effect, taking responsibility and social relationships into account in our utilitarian calculation.


War should be for important reasons. ... the absence of a just cause makes it very difficult for a war to satisfy proportionality.

Last chance reasoning: If necessity and proportionality are satisfied, then the reasonable prospects of success standard is irrelevant.



# jus in bellum

1.  Discrimination: belligerents must always distinguish between military objectives and civilians, and intentionally attack only military objectives.
2.  Proportionality: foreseen but unintended harms must be proportionate to the military advantage achieved.
3.  Necessity: the least harmful means feasible must be used.

Indeed, traditional just war theory recognizes only two kinds of justification for war: national defence (of one’s own state or of an ally) and humanitarian intervention. What’s more, humanitarian intervention is permissible only to avert the very gravest of tragedies— ==“crimes that shock the moral conscience of mankind”== (Walzer 2006: 107).

Note: The wording here is very individual. There is an appeal to a tribal "sense of shock" at "cultural" (?) norms far different from ones own -- and also assumes a single moral consciousness for the entirety of mankind. In the context of a hyperbalkanized society (e.g. an interplanetary one), it would be near impossible for the existence of a single moral conscience. This begs the question: do we currently  have a single moral conscience? Can the existence of a single moral conscience exist with a difference of cultures?



>Blameworthy responsibility for other people’s false beliefs does seem relevant to the ethics of self- and other-defence. That said, consider an idiot who pretends to be a suicide bomber as a prank, and is shot by a police officer (Ferzan 2005; McMahan 2005c). Is killing him objectively permissible? It seems doubtful. The officer’s justified belief that the prankster posed a threat clearly diminishes the wrongfulness of killing him (Lazar 2015a). And certainly the prankster’s fault excuses the officer of any guilt. But killing the prankster still seems objectively wrong. Even if someone’s blameworthy responsibility for false beliefs could make killing him objectively permissible, most philosophers agree that many unjust combatants are not to blame for the injustice of their wars (McMahan 1994; Lazar 2010).

Is it objectively wrong to kill someone who is 70% a suicide bomber and 30% a prankster? You don't know which one but you need to shoot or might get killed.

>Warfare can be justified, then, by a combination of liability and lesser evil grounds. Some unjust combatants lose their rights not to be killed. Others’ rights can be overridden without that implying that unjust noncombatants’ rights may be overridden too. We can reject the pacifist horn of the responsibility dilemma. But a moderate Combatant Equality is likely to be true: since killing innocent combatants is not the worst kind of killing, it is correspondingly easier for unjust combatants to justify using lethal force (at least against just combatants). This increases the range of cases in which they can satisfy Discrimination, Proportionality, and Necessity, and so fight permissibly.

Much hangs, then, on the arguments for Moral Distinction. Some focus on why killing innocent noncombatants is especially wrongful; others on why killing innocent combatants is not so bad. This section considers the second kind of argument, returning to the first in the next section.

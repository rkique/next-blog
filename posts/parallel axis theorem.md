We want to find the [[Rotational Inertia]] from an axis parallel to the one that runs down the center of a cylinder.

We can use the parallel axis theorem:

$I_{\text{par}} = I_{\text{center}} + mh^2$ 

where h is the distance between the two axis.

This is a direct result of the integration as $\int mr^2$

This allows us to extend the various moments of inertia found in [[Rotational Inertia]] defined for the centers of objects, to other axii.

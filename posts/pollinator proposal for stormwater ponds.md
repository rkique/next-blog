## pollinator guide
Pollinators, including bees, flies, and moths, are essential for agriculture. Their populations have declined in recent years, having lost the majority of their habitat to humans & human monoculture. From the Pacific Lowland Mixed Forest Province Guide to [*Selecting Plants for Pollinators*](https://www.pollinator.org/PDFs/Guides/PacificLowlandrx9FINAL.pdf) 

> Whether you are a farmer of many acres, land manager of a large tract of land, or a gardener with a small lot, you can increase the number of pollinators in your area by making conscious choices to include plants that provide essential habitat for bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, hummingbirds and other pollinators
> Flowers provide nectar (high in sugar and necessary amino acids) and pollen (high in protein) to pollinators.

## concept
We can make use of the grassland around the wetlands to plant no-maintenance pollinator-friendly flowers. Select a few attractive native plants (from the guide above) that are decent spreaders and which can put up a fight against invasive species, i.e. buttercup weeds. Seed them on high ground and hillsides within the stormwater reserve areas (not swamps). This seeding only needs to be done once, and it should require a low investment of time. Even if only a fifth of the ponds end up retaining flowers, its a vast improvement over no pollinator habitat at all.

## in practice
Yearly care (as we are doing now) will not change much at all. The seasonal employees will still need to do only one yearly trim on each pond.

**However, instead of pursuing a height based policy, we would instead plan to just remove high growth vegetation (like blackberries & noxious weeds) while leaving planted flowers intact.**

Public support for pollinator habitat restoration would be very high. Recent efforts in the city of Berlin doing something similar were extremely popular: an investment of 1.5 million euros for planting and maintaining 50 wildflower gardens over 3 years. 300 some species of wild bees in Germany, over half of which are endangered. They planted both endangered flowers which blossomed in two years, and popular ones like poppies and cornflowers (which blossom after a year).

From here this is my plan:
- [ ] Talk to Chris and Leah about the plan draft. Take suggestions, meet, revise as needed.
	- [ ] the policy right now is "cut everything above six inches" due to a (NPDS code?) . Is this necessary for approving stormwater ponds? If it is, can we work around it by redrawing the pond borders or petitioning enforcement?

Once approved ... 
- [ ] I will then talk to Cameron at the City of Lynnwood Hatchery (who I worked with on a pollinator strip project), or look at Xerces.com or Pollinator.org for a list of pollinator friendly plants / flower mixes). Or talk to other knowledgeable employees (city gardeners/florists?)
- [ ] Obtain seeds
- [ ] Then in the autumn I (or the City) will plant them in select areas.
	- [ ] This will mostly be on the flat grassy areas I've noticed so far, and on hillsides
		- [ ] e.g. the Woodinville Heights ponds (grass far apart from wetland)
		- [ ] Hollywood Hills pond (grass, earth ramp down to wetland)
		- [ ] The large Woodinville-Duvall pond where daisies currently grow
		- **Most ponds have large grass spaces, which is why I believe this **
- [ ] No maintenance necessary! The wildflowers will survive on their own.

## outreach
The "public" outreach aspect of this can be anything from nothing, to a small sign indicating the city's efforts in planting pollinator flowers (and explaining their benefits), to lowering line-of-sight obstructions (e.g. fences) for allowing public appreciation of flowers. 

## addendum: stormwater ponds as public space
A remote but extremely appealing possibility is making non-swamp portions of stormwater ponds public in a trial period for neighborhood and community use (e.g. removing locks from the ponds at Hollywood Hills/ Woodinville Heights). This would not be the same as a regular park and would be largely community-maintained space, provided at the discretion of the City.

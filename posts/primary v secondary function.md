Things have single functions, i.e. to lift something, carry it horizontally,  Secondary attributes -- safety latches, wheels, lights -- are necessary additions because of the complications of the primary function.

What are the important primary functions? Carrying things sideways is important because we want to be able to sort everything on earth for our own uses. 

- Attaching things to other things is important.
- Sending messages is important
- Storing information is important

One interesting and counterintuitive "single function" is that of dead weight. In order to secure something in place, you forego the primary function of an object in favor of its weight alone.

The existence of markings on roads are a secondary attribute necessary to coordinate multiple primary functions. A car can travel fine on a road without markings.

- hard hats, safety equipment, signaling

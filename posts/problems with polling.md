Polling has problems.

“non-response bias”—a fancy way of saying that cell-phones users tend not to answer calls from numbers they don’t recognize (like pollsters’), and that people have grown increasingly coy when asked about their political views.

The first question a pollster should ask,” the sociologist Leo Bogart advised in 1972, is “ ‘Have you thought about this at all? Do you _have_ an opinion?’ ”

>Pollster.com’s Mark Blumenthal has recalled how, in the nineteen-eighties, when the response rate at the firm where he was working had fallen to about sixty per cent, people in his office said, “What will happen when it’s only twenty? We won’t be able to be in business!” A typical response rate is now in the single digits.

...More than forty per cent of America’s adults no longer have landlines, and the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act bans autodialling to cell phones.


# are polls really _good_?
Measuring public opinion is bad for democracy.

“media polls give us distorted readings of the electoral climate, manufacture a false public consensus on policy issues, and in the process undermine American democracy.” Polls don’t take the pulse of democracy; they raise it.

- [[Walter Lippmann]]: Lippmann believed that “public opinion” is a fiction created by political élites to suit and advance their interests.
- In 1947, in an address to the American Sociological Association, Herbert Blumer argued that public opinion does not exist, absent its measurement. Pollsters proceed from the assumption that “public opinion” is an aggregation of individual opinions, each given equal weight—an assumption Blumer demonstrated to be preposterous, since people form opinions “as a function of a society in operation.”

But polls are largely free from government regulation, or even scrutiny. (This is not true in other countries; Canadian election law, for instance, regulates the disclosure of election polls.)

# case study: 	_Literary Digest_ and Gallup
> The best predictions were made by a national magazine, the _Literary Digest_, beginning in 1916. It regularly miscalculated the popular vote, but for a long time it got the Electoral College winner right. In 1920, the _Digest_ mailed out eleven million ballots. By 1932, its mailing list had swelled to twenty million. Most of those names were taken from telephone directories and automobile-registration files.
>  George Gallup was one of the few people who understood that the _Digest_ risked underestimating Democratic votes, especially as the Depression deepened, because its sample, while very big, was not very representative: **people who supported F.D.R. were much less likely than the rest of the population to own a telephone or a car.**





# yes, they are
Like Rivers, Lupia ardently believes in the importance of measuring public opinion. “It is critical for a nation that cherishes its democratic legitimacy to seek credible measures of how citizens think, feel, and act in electoral contexts,” Lupia and the political scientist Jon Krosnick have written. Otherwise, “there will be no strong evidentiary basis for differentiating propagandistic tall tales from empirically defensible and logically coherent readings of electoral history.”

He believes that polling “improves the quality of representation.” I asked him to give me an example. He said, “You couldn’t have had the change in gay marriage without the polling data.” Everyone cares where the rockets come down.
 
But they also move us closer to a direct democracy, circumventing representatives through incentivizing them to vote with the public.

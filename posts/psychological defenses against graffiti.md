A nice series of ideas which deter taggers by increasing the risk or decreasing the reward. 

Dazzle camouflage, visual static. Many small tiles of color (including black) to reduce visual satisfaction and prevent masking from creating blank canvases.

dazzle lettering: repurposing illegible "near-english" script for obscuring the addition of words. Lots of lines and curves in varying sizes.

A sprinkler pointed at the park which turns on at random intervals during the night.

Motion activated lights which completely remove the thrill of not being caught.
Motion activated speakers, same idea.

Red lighting to throw off color scheme, reduce contrast

supply free stencils and paint at the park to decrease exclusive nature of tagging and individuality, supply free paint to concerned parenting groups etc.

social pressure: if tag out of allowed area all graffiti will be removed

qPCR is the same as RT-PCR, or realtime PCR.

It is a form of amplification that produces florescent curves through which it is possible to detect, characterize and quantify the initial nucleic acids. It is an analytical step on its own, not merely an amplification as with traditional [[PCR]].

## measuring gene expression
Gene expression, or mRNA synthesis, is a critical part of protein synthesis. Using reverse transcriptase, the researcher first creates complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of the RNA in their sample, and then performs qPCR with that cDNA.

[[Asset Protection]]

- a rare disease which people want to transmit to rich people so that they will have the influence to find a cure

- anti-elite overproduction dream modifiers
	- State-mandated antimemetics which protect you from unrealistic dreams perpetuated by the mainstream media --> the "anti-media"
		- becoming an actor, politics, academia, music
		- "Protected Class Cycle"
		- These mandates fluctuate with the demands of society
		- Lobbyists against these antimemetics from the disciplines who need this underclass to survive
	- large self-sufficient contingent who move far north

- PG's earnestness --> asset protection attorneys for  who help optimize public facing socials


- [[Dreamhooks]]: dreams which end with advertisement,  delicious strangeness fading to [airbrushedness]
	- white staircases leading up to a beautifully furnished door, fields of wheat split by tractors.

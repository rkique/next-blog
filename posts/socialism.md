### Saint Simon >> Veblen, Owenites
Technocratic, meritocratic utopian socialist [[SSC & LW/@LW|lw]]

>Saint-Simon stressed the need for recognition of the merit of the individual and the need for hierarchy of merit in society and in the economy such as society having hierarchical merit-based organizations of managers and scientists to be the decision-makers in government.[11] Saint-Simon strongly criticized any expansion of government intervention into the economy beyond ensuring no hindrances to productive work and reducing idleness in society, regarding intervention beyond these as too intrusive.[10]

Veblen's institutional economics [[veblen good]]
Owenite: bourgeois roots but became radicalized as left society
"Moral economy": 
	Owenism aimed for radical reform of society and is considered a forerunner of the ==cooperative movement.== ([[Walkaway, Cory Doctorow]]) 
		
		The Owenite movement undertook several experiments in the establishment of utopian communities organized according to communitarian and cooperative principles

Marxist socialism is the transformation of society, not the government
## INCOMPATIBILITY
	Marx and Engels refers to democratic republic as “dictatorship of the proletariat”
	
Marx embodies a schizophrenia towards utopianism and power politics. 
	
	in Marx's most profound theories there were both an "objective" account of a socialist future preordained by the evolution of the capitalist economy and a sober analysis of how socialism must be the work of human freedom.
	
Never resolved this contradiction.
Karl Kautsky focused on this first idea of socialism as inexorable, human triumph.

## democracy
Engels: "view on [[democracy]] and universal suffrage changed from a placating, false, institution for organizing state power EXPLOITED to become a worker led attack on the state power."

Marx broke with the utopians on his approach to instituting socialism. His strategy would be to win the battle of democracy. 
- expropriating landed property	
- abolishing inheritance
- instituting progressive taxes
- central bank
- national factories
- free education

German constitution of 1871 created a Reichstag elected by universal suffrage, but it could only debate. The Diet, the dominant federal state, was chosen based on a class electoral system. Bismarck illegalized socialism and then offered social welfare.

Kautsky 1:
"Our task is not to organize the revolution, but to organize ourselves for the revolution; it is not to make the revolution but to take advantage of it".

Kautsky 2:

Capitalism is becoming more concentrated, so the socialist state needs to be as well. All of the cooperative/decentralized versions of socialization (Fourier utopias etc.) have been rendered obselete. -- "There is only one cooperative which can be used as a framework in which to develop the socialist system, and that is the MODERN STATE". However, this was **not** a statist socialism.

	The German socialist definition of socialism was not state ownership of the means of production, but democratic state ownership of the means of production.

# What did I learn today?

Germany Social Democratic programs never accomplished a socialist revolution, but operated within democratic capitalism to effect meaningful change. Kautsky and others were not able to formulate a definition of socialism: was it the incontrovertible final state of capitalism or something which people had to fight for? Through democratic or nondemocratic means? Etc.

Michael Harrington calls Communism a Collectivist Bureaucracy, a false friend of socialism which claims to be socialism.

	The nationalized means of production were necessary for achieving modern economy: an antidemocratic collectivization planned by the state is one way to try to compress the brutalities of that process of "primitive accumulation" so as to allow the creation of independent national economies in a matter of decades.

power & technocracy: [[Le Corbusier]], [[science & society]]

	The notion that the Soviet Model is "real" socialism is a right-wing Hegelian argument that whatever is must be rational.
	
Marx, Engels: Feudal, petty bourgeois, abstract intellectual, and conservative-bourgeois socialisms are false socialisms.

_Does a movement claiming to be socialist in fact institutionalize the power of the people over the means of production? Or does it rationalize the power of a dominant class or stratum over the people?_

# valence
>One of the most common views of valence is that it’s the way the brain encodes value: Emotional feelings (affects) are intrinsic values that inform animals how they are faring in the quest to survive. The various positive affects indicate that animals are returning to “comfort zones” that support survival, and negative affects reflect “discomfort zones” that indicate that animals are in situations that may impair survival. 

>They are ancestral tools for living – evolutionary memories of such importance that they were coded into the genome in rough form (as primary brain processes), which are refined by basic learning mechanisms (secondary processes) as well as by higher-order cognitions/thoughts (tertiary processes). (Panksepp 2010) Similarly, valence seems to be a mechanism the brain uses to determine or label salience, or phenomena worth paying attention

“The Information Principle,” where “\[e\]motional feelings provide conscious information from unconscious appraisals of situations”

>positive valence is generally modeled as the result of an outcome being better than expected (Schultz 2015), or a surprising decrease in ’reward prediction errors’ (RPEs)

e.g. prepackaged behaviors which can skip the time and energy necessary to rationalize:

>if things are going surprisingly well, the brain tries to take advantage of this momentum by shifting into a happier state that is more suited to exploration & exploitation. On the other hand, if things are going surprisingly poorly, the brain shifts into a “hunker-down” mode which conserves resources and options.

>....However – while these functional descriptions [of valence] are intuitive, elegant, and appear to explain quite a lot, frustratingly, they fall apart as metaphysically-satisfying answers when we look closely at edge-cases and the anatomy of pain and pleasure

... for every functional story about the role of valence, there exist counter-examples

# how do they do that


1.(Berridge and Kringelbach 2013) find that “representation [of value] and causation [of pleasure] may actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions.”
(Jensen et al. 2007) note that salience is also handled by different, non-perfectly-overlapping systems in the brain.

2 .. (Berridge, Robinson, and Aldridge 2009) find that what we call ’reward’ has three distinct elements in the brain: ’wanting’, ’liking’, and ’learning’, and the neural systems supporting each are each relatively distinct from each other. ’Wanting’, a.k.a. seeking, seems strongly (though not wholly) dependent upon the mesolimbic dopamine system, whereas ’liking’, or the actual subjective experience of pleasure, seems to depend upon the opioid, endocannabinoid, and GABA-benzodiazepine neurotransmitter systems, but only within the context of a handful of so-called “hedonic hotspots” (elsewhere, their presence seems to only increase ’wanting’). With the right interventions disabling each system, it looks like brains can exhibit any permutation of these three: ’wanting and learning without liking’, ’wanting and liking without learning’, and so on. Likewise with pain, we can roughly separate the sensory/discriminative component from the affective/motivational component, each of which can be modulated independently (Shriver 2016)

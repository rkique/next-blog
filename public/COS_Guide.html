    <p>This summer, I did research at University of Colorado Colorado
        Springs in a REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program. UCCS
        is located just off of the Rocky Mountains and is located over a mile
        (6,035’) over sea level! I loved spending time there, and haven’t found
        much information about the program online. Here’s a list of things to do in
        Colorado Springs: some information is geared towards the REU students
        specifically, and some just for anyone in the area.</p>

    <h2><strong>Transit</strong></h2> <p>The disadvantages of COS public transit
        (Mountain Metro Transit) is they are not very frequent, and end early on
        weekends (No bus service after 5pm). However the buses here also run
        really early, like around 6:40am, and are cheap (or free). The two main
        routes serving campus is the 9 route and the 34 route. The 9 goes
        downtown, while the 34 goes down Garden of the Gods road. I used the 34
        after work on weekdays to get to Springs Climbing Center pretty
        often.</p>
    <p>There is a campus shuttle that runs on weekdays and can pick you up
        from the Ent Center for the Arts. It runs every fifteen minutes and is
        super helpful for grocery runs.</p>
    <p>A really great surprise was learning about the Bustang shuttles,
        which can get you from Colorado Springs to Denver or Pueblo for just $12
        one way. You need to get a separate app for it, but there is service
        from downtown and other locations in COS.</p>
    <h2><strong>Hikes</strong></h2><p> I recommend hiking in the early morning, or
        bringing a flashlight in the evening.</p>
    <p><strong>University Park Bluff</strong>: If you run on North Academy
        and head south towards the University Park residential community, head
        towards the satellite tower at the top (behind the Alpine Village).
        There is an amazing view of the city, a pullup bar, and a quick scramble
        down to the dorms.</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/UP.jpeg">
    <p><strong>University Trail System</strong>: These trails go
        through the Austin Bluffs northeast of the school, and you can access
        them by walking down Clyde Way and up Eagle Rock.The Spine Trail takes
        you around ridges to the top of a protruding bluff.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Spine.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Pulpit Rock</strong>: This was the first hike I did in the
        area, located maybe two miles from the campus. You get great views of
        the Rockies and Nevada road, and the highway that runs through town. It
        is a landmark of UCCS. I also visited during the nighttime: the rock
        felt almost florescent underneath.</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/Pulpit_Rock.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Barr Trail</strong>: These trails are located in the back of
        Manitou Springs, which is a town 8 or 9 miles from campus at the foot of
        Pike’s Peak and the other mountains. Barr Trail leads to Barr Camp about
        6.5 miles up and then to Pike’s Peak at 13.1. Barr Camp is great, it’s a
        wooded campground with ample camping spots, water, and a shop. From Barr
        Camp, you can try some other trails; I walked the Elk Park trail which
        took me to the north of Pike’s Peak.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Elk_Park.jpeg"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p><strong>The Manitou Incline</strong> is a very steep stairway that
        connects to the Barr Trail at around mile 3. I never did this but it is
        super popular and definitely something I want to do in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Lower Columbine/Gold Camp Trail</strong>: These trails are
        also around Cheyenne Mountain, and lead you into the valley of Manitou
        Springs. These are red gravel and fairly steep, I never got to explore
        them completely but great views of the city and plains from afar (the
        handful of skyscrapers in downtown look tiny)</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/Columbine.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Mount Muscoco</strong>: This is a difficult short climb up a
        smaller mountain. The view of the Rockies is impressive, you get a much
        better idea of how huge they are.</p>
    <p><strong>Seven Falls:</strong> These falls are actually one big
        waterfall broken into seven pieces! And a waterfall is just one slice of
        water distorting itself across time and space… There are trails at the
        top of the falls that lead you to a nice outlook where Cave of the Winds
        people zipline from. There’s also a trail to Midnight Falls, which is
        like ten feet tall so it might be disappointing to some.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Seven_Falls.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Palmer Park</strong>: Definitely one of my favorite places to
        visit, although every time I did I got lost on the way back down. You
        can take the Templeton Gap trail to get here. The Yucca Flats are on the
        top, a flat loop so good for training purposes. There are running/hiking
        trails around it and a great view of the Rockies. Lots of cactuses and
        shrubs dotting the sides.</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/Palmer_Park.jpeg">

    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p><strong>Pike’s Peak Greenway</strong>: There are two directions:
        south towards downtown or north towards Monument. The south direction
        leads to the Olympic Museum/ America the Beautiful Park, while the north
        direction leads to the gravel Sante Fe trail. The Sante Fe trail has
        better views, and runs right next to a railroad. Other notable landmarks
        on the North trail include Great Wolf Lodge, Bass Pro Shops Outdoor
        World, the white covered skeletons of new developments… There’s a lot
        more to explore.</p>
    <p><strong>Ute Valley</strong>: This park has amazing views of the
        Rockies as well, it is located near their base to the north. Lots of
        mountain biking trails.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Ute_Valley.jpeg">
    <h2><strong>Coffee Shops</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>UVC Starbucks</strong>: This place was open until 9pm
        everyday so it gets the top mention. It’s less than a mile from Alpine
        Village, it is down and up one big hill though.</p>
    <p><strong>Poor Richards</strong>: Half converted bookstore, half cafe.
        The converted bookstore is really big, not as much science and
        nonfiction as I hoped for. I really wish I had the chance to spend more
        time here: they are open everyday at the same hours. They have live
        music every week in the patio area, and do improv as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Kairos:</strong> This was recommended online, and it
        really is a great place to go read books and think. It is a
        Victorian/Baroque setting with chandeliers and carpeted floors, and run
        by a youth ministry. They have good vegetarian options. This is a 5
        minute walk off Garden of the Gods road.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Kairos.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Lincoln Center/Building Three</strong>: Set inside of a
        former schoolhouse, this place has plenty of tables and is right next to
        one of the 9 stops. The atmosphere is very clean and professional. It’s
        also open consistently on the weekends unlike Kairos. If you want a
        haircut there is also a barber here.</p>
        <img class="fr" style="width: 20%" src="cos-images/Building_Three.jpeg">
    <p><strong>1979</strong>: A coffee shop off of the Pike’s Peak Greenway.
        It has great reviews on Yelp and it is actually a great place to work or
        study. Bike down the Greenway and cross a railroad to get there. I
        didn’t know before going in that it is part of a Woodmen megachurch.
        Apparently they hold service while it is open, they just take a break
        for coffee and then resume service. It’s an interesting place to
        explore.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/1979.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Solar Roast Coffee</strong>: A downtown spot with
        records/music for sale, and also a lot of news articles about their
        unique solar-powered coffee roaster. Also a great place to work and
        contemplate things.</p>
        <p><strong>La Baguette</strong>: A downtown cafe with marked-down
            old croissants. <br><br>
            <strong>Big Cat Coffee</strong>: The university
        coffee shop! They have a variety of snacks as well. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>GoG
            Starbucks</strong>: Located conveniently a couple miles down Garden of
        the Gods.</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/La Baguette.jpeg">
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Solar_Roast.jpeg">
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h2><strong>Other</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Springs Climbing Center</strong>: A really spacious sport
        climbing gym. The climbs start at V1 and go to V11-12, and are about
        half a grade easier the gyms I’ve been to. They have a competition wall
        and belay climbing as well.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/SCC.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Spencer’s Produce, Lawn and Garden</strong>: This place
        (located in South COS) may seem like a home improvement store but they
        have a great selection of local produce, sauces, and jams in the back.
        They also give out paper money which you can spend on Spencer Buck
        Days.</p>
    <p><strong>Basecamp Books</strong>: This is a bookstore located in a
        strip mall! It’s much larger than I expected from the storefront, they
        have a good selection of different genres.</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/Basecamp_Books.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Hooked on Books</strong>: A classic used bookstore located
        downtown. I got a poetry anthology from here.</p>
    <p><strong>Roadhouse Cinemas</strong>: A movie theater where you can
        order food from the seats. It was an odd experience that felt like a scene from Wall-E, some people
        might enjoy it. There’s also a more classic arcade attached.</p>
    <p><strong>Gunther Toody’s</strong>: A 50s / 60s motorcycle-themed diner
        that plays Tom and Jerry on repeat.</p>
    <p><strong>Novis Mortem</strong>: A curiosities shop with crawling and
        flying insects (not for sale). They sell butterfly wings here for “art”
        projects, as well as a wide range of cool stickers and prints.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Novis_Mortem.jpeg">
        <p><strong>Supernova</strong>: This is a bar and arcade in one building.
        The machines cost a quarter &amp; the vibe is very chill. There is a
        jukebox here too.</p>
    <p><strong>Crooked Cue</strong>: This is a pool-house downtown with a
        lot of tables.</p>
    <p><strong>Pike’s Peak or Bust Rodeo</strong>: Definitely worth going to
        if you’ve never been to a rodeo! They have lots of tents set up outside
        selling cowboy hats, military gear, newly forged knives etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Skate City</strong>: A roller rink open until 11pm most
        days.</p>
    <p><strong>Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science</strong>: So fun and
        interesting! Unrealistic polar bear nuclear families, walruses hunting
        with their tusks in the sand, rocks and minerals, mammal fossils from
        near Colorado Springs, dinosaurs, the human body (they have several
        dissected ones on display), outer space, butterfly specimens. There’s
        one really cool exhibit about the astrological instruments made by the
        Native tribes in the area. It’s fun to see how the focus changes between
        the older exhibits “we will instruct you on basic facts about our
        discipline”, to the special new ones: “Mouse vs. Scorpion!
        Here are stats on their specific abilities and defenses, which
        are probably already out of date”.</p>
        <img class="fl" src="cos-images/Denver_Science.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Denver Museum of Art</strong>: A lot of it is geared towards
        encouraging young artists and interactive exhibits. My favorite exhibits
        here were on the second floor of the contemporary gallery.</p>
    <p><strong>Mutiny Information Cafe</strong>: Another amazing bookstore +
        cafe in Denver, on South Broadway. The books here are really
        well-priced, I bought a backpackful.</p>
        <img class="fr" src="cos-images/Mutiny.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Novation</strong>: A EDM venue that hosts weekly events in
        Denver</p>
    <p><strong>Places I didn’t visit but were recommended</strong></p>

    <p>Paradise Cove</p>
    <p>Rocky Mountain National Park</p>
    <p>Mount Edgar</p>

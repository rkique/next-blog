<h1>high school students and cancer cure claims</h1>

<p>(draft)</p>

<p>TLDR: I don't think any high school student has created a novel cancer treatment, despite multiple claims to the contrary in media/discussion. The "cure cancer" claim is an important one to track because of how much it <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fapplyingtocollege+%22cure+cancer%22&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS920US920&oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fapplyingtocollege+%22cure+cancer%22&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.10288j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">permeates the public consciousness</a> and the varying levels of credulity attached to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arjun looked into the use of a new antibiotic (17-AAG) to defeat cancer’s defence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Photothermal therapy involves injecting a patient with gold nanoparticles. These particles are useful because they accumulate in tumours, forming “nano-bullets” that can be heated to kill cancer. However, one problem with photothermal therapy is cancer cells fighting back, producing heat-shock proteins to protect themselves. The antibiotic 17-AAG can prevent those cells from doing so.</p>
<p>Two quotes stand out to me from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof-of-concepts were developed and tested in order to demonstrate the viability of PTT [photothermal therapy],” says Arjun. “Moreover, after analyzing the literature [reading papers] a mathematical model was developed to evaluate a theoretical synergetic treatment.” </p>
<p>Arjun’s research, which a panel of expert judges led by Dr. Luis Barreto called “world class Masters or PhD-level quality,” also won a special $1,000 prize awarded to the project with the greatest commercial potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His project was done under significant mentorship at the Nanoscience Labs at the University of Calgary. Dr. Cramb, Dr. Simon Trudel and Lab Manager, Amy Tekrony provided access and mentorship. It was done over the course of two years. The work is really cool, but not novel. Similar research was published by ASU researchers two years earlier in 2011, as &quot;Synergistic administration of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy&quot;: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559185/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559185/</a>. Synergistic here means that it combines photothermal therapy (gold nanoparticles), and chemotherapy (17-AAG). It is the same approach described above.</p>
<p>In fact, at that time there were already <strong>clinical trials</strong> being conducted for the synergetic treatment Arjun outlines above <em>theoretically</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heat-shock protein (HSP) 90 inhibitor 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in clinical trials for different malignancies, including for (hyperthermia + 17-AAG).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without seeing the project itself, it is hard to evaluate the work done, but there is definitely significant hyperbole in the way the media has framed the context for Arjun&#39;s work. Using 17-AAG in cancer therapy is not new. Arjun did not actually conduct clinical trials on 17-AAG, only model its effects on photothermal therapy. </p>

<p>Angela&#39;s project is called Design of Image-guided, Photo-thermal Controlled Drug Releasing Multifunctional Nanosystem for the Treatment of Cancer Stem Cells. She won the Siemens grand prize (100k).</p>
<p>She designed a novel nanosystem for cancer stem cell treatment, which uses a gold and iron-oxide based nanoparticle to target only tumors in photothermal therapy. It releases drugs, allows for imaging, and monitors the site. Zhang tested this system in mice and it worked successfully, eliminating almost all malignant tumors.</p>

<p>This is BY FAR the best claim to a cancer cure by a high school student and might be the origin of the meme. It is not, however, a cancer cure.</p>
<p>There have been no clinical trials of her treatment beyond mice, and no papers published on her trials with mice. There was also lot of similar work being done at that time. Here&#39;s an overview of nanoparticle treatments from June 2012, around the same time as her work: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724376/">Hybrid gold-iron oxide nanoparticles as a multifunctional platform for biomedical application</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data highlights the potential of these HNPs as dual function MRI contrast agents and nano-heaters for therapies such as <strong>cellular hyperthermia</strong> or <strong>thermo-responsive drug delivery</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(these are the two uses which Zhang mentions)

<p>Hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles were invented in 2005.

<p>The news focuses on photothermal therapy and Angela&#39;s use of hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles because it seems cool: use nanoparticles to screen for cancer cells, then shine an infrared light on them to remove them. However, this approach (imaging and contrast agents for monitoring drug delivery) has already been a part of clinical intervention for a long time. In the last ten years, nanomedicine has focused almost exclusively on nanoparticle technology for cancer. That technology, in turn, has focused almost exclusively on gold and iron oxide nanoparticles and their use in photothermal therapy. (<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4960239">https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4960239</a>). </p>
<p>The fact that an experimental nanoparticle treatment uses gold and iron oxide nanoparticles is not anything exotic or new, because almost all nanoparticle based treatments for cancer use them too.</p>

<p>What is really important is the work that she did in designing the nanoparticle. Is her nanoparticle a novel and promising approach to cancer treatment? Stanford Medicine says this about her work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2009 (8th grade), she observed lab meetings and work at a radiology lab under Zhen Cheng, a professor at Stanford who specializes in nanoparticles. In 2010 and 2011, she did internships where she learned to make nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Zhang learned how to carry out the chemical reactions and started planning a nanosystem that would work to treat cancer and image the treatment’s outcome. The result was a design for a tiny machine made of paired gold and iron oxide nanoparticles to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer stem cells. A magnet applied to the tumor site can pull the iron oxide particles into place, peptides coating the particles help assure they bind to biomarkers on cancer stem cells, and the gold and iron oxide show up clearly using various imaging techniques including MRI. To top it off, the release of the drug would be controlled by laser beam. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Siemens competition judge says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She showed great creativity and initiative in designing a nanoparticle system that can be triggered to release drugs at the site of the tumor while also allowing for noninvasive imaging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She combines <strong>existing cancer treatment and diagnosis methods</strong> into a single new nanoparticle, through the application of known nanoparticle design methods. The design itself is clearly novel. However, it is novel not in expanding medical capabilities, but instead in combining existing methods into what she calls a &quot;swiss army knife&quot; of cancer treatments.</p>
<p>It is, maybe, a breakthrough in nanoparticle design. It is not a breakthrough in cancer research, and involves no novel cancer treatments or diagnostics.</p>

<p>High school student Jack Andraka won $75,000 and national science prizes for successfully detecting mesothelin through dipstick assays, an existing method for inexpensive protein detection.</p>
<p>A response from Pancreatic Cancer Action Network:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The studies Jack performed show that the test he developed for the protein he is interested in, called mesothelin, is a good, reliable assay that detects very low levels of the protein in the bloodstream of mice.</p>
<p>We do not yet know how much mesothelin is circulating in the bloodstream of patients whose disease is caught early enough to be eligible for surgery, or those with pre-cancer. Many promising biomarkers have worked in the case of cancer where levels are high, but have subsequently failed in tests that aim for early detection. This is because the levels of the marker are generally much lower in patients with small, early lesions compared to levels in the patients with more advanced disease that make up the test population.</p>

<h3>my cultural influences</h3>
        <p>2024 Update: What I wrote below, they are mostly all true. They are larger in scale and more unfiltered than I would be comfortable putting out now. But, you can never be proud of something you haven't written.</p>
        <div class='small'>
            <p>Most people aren't motivated by art</p>
            <p><a href="https://dirt.fyi/"> https://dirt.fyi/ </a></p>
            <p>Art and appreciation are necessary luxuries: I wouldn't be who I am without them. They are not </p>
            <p>community is a stabilizing force, work about it or against it is uninteresting</p>
            <p>"There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons. My life is a series of stratagems, to avoid, and outwit that guy."</p>
            <p>You really, really, can't do everything. Art about where you live makes you feel good but is not inherently relatable.</p>
            <p>Online art is not self-sufficient</p>
            <p>You can do certain things really well. Asking questions, understanding the big picture, grit. </p>
            <p>success is (still) not defined by others. Nobody knows what they're doing or why they're doing it.</p>
            <p>Putting everything in is incomprehensible. Taking (almost) everything out while still saying something is the challenge.</p>
            <p>I don't believe in concrete correspondences ("why'd they invent imaginary numbers?") but not all numbers are equally interesting. In a vacuum (as the system would like it to be) financial data is especially not interesting. Random noise, most generated outputs (RISD SBI led me to this realization), "weather", speculation, bad models that aren't meant to be bad, and good models that don't say much are also not interesting. 
            </p>
            <p>Predictably, my tastes have changed from science and architecture to drama, tragedy, anthropology. The reason is hopefully not a lack of imagination but the overwhelming reality of otherworldly locality that can be seen and not read, and understanding the depth and rarity of unique human emotion. The local is better than the unreal, and the real can always be local. But I want to hold onto the shells of self-discovery. </p>
            <p>99%, universal principles of design</p>
            <p>What can be sacrificed? It is not enough to notice and want a change. You usually must give something up.</p>
            <p>I hope my mistakes get smaller with time.</p>
            <p>I still don't think I'm failing enough.</p>
            <p>To intelligibly characterize a difference is to make something new. But 'make' has gone through the washing machine a few too many times.</p>
            <p>I am the only person who has ever stood in this exact position on earth --> I am the only person who could come up wih any of this.</p>
            <p></p>
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <p>2021 What makes something interesting? I've been radicalized on this issue for a long time. It is the reason why this
            blog exists at all. I've consistently struggled to put those thoughts in writing; in lieu of an essay, I've
            made a list of things that say something meaningful about the time and place I live. I'll try to keep this
            updated. </p>

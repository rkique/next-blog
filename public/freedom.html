I turned eighteen last month, and something that I've become increasingly aware of is the difference between optionality and freedom. 
<br><br>
As a kid I wanted to do everything. I spend days convinced that I want to be a scientist, an artist, a forest ranger. I have a lot of options and I'm able to keep each of my contradictory dreams alive. 
<br><br>
As long as I don't commit, I have a hypothetical freedom. At any moment, it is possible for me to suddenly learn what I want to do for the rest of my life and strive towards that unceasingly. But this optionality is different than freedom. 
<br><br>
Optionality is inertia. It is a low energy state. Get good grades, don't do drugs, work on things that I like. Like a homing pigeon, it is expected that with all my options open, I gradually settle in onto something I can call my life's calling.
<br><br>
On the other hand, freedom requires agency. It is the rejection of the illusion of free will afforded by optionality. It is, paradoxically, the ability to lose options, to really choose what I want and drop everything else.
<br><br>
Because at some later time, instead of being at an advantage due to my optionality, I fall behind. Every one of my dreams have become corrupted, because I couldn't bear to separate the healthy ones from the sick. A grey gloom descends upon each of my dreams, as committment date --perhaps the day on which I knew taxidermy would be my life's calling, or the day I moved to a monastery to play CSGO competitively-- get pushed improbably and precariously high. 
<br><br>
People who really love what they do have stories from their youth. Learning to ski in their backyard at the age of four. Eating a raw oyster on a fishing boat. Lacking such a crucial anecdote from my childhood, a totem of my infatuation which would get reinforced and mythologized with each retelling, at times it feels that I will be forced to do a job which I do not love. It would be a failure to become, an eternal adolescence. This is a terrifying prospect: but is it more terrifying than choosing the wrong thing?

<h1>Game theory isn't morality</h1>

<p>(draft)[[utilitarianism]] [[consequentialism]] [[deontology]]</p>

<p>MacNamara&#39;s perspective within <em>Fog of War</em> should not be taught as an unfiltered primary source and the only source on WWII in the Game Theory and Geopolitics course. </p>
<p>Teaching America&#39;s role in WWII from the perspective of game theory alone (e.g. from the McNamaran perspective, the utilitarian hedging of hypothetical deaths against one another) is incomplete. This incompleteness is <em>itself</em> immoral, presenting a false dichotomy which provides carte blanche justification for war crimes. It leads to us being assigned to find supporting evidence for game-theoretic statements like &quot;<em>Maximize Efficiency</em>&quot;, by which McNamara means we should kill people as efficiently as possible, and &quot;<em>In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil</em>&quot;, by which McNamara justifies the dropping of the atomic bomb. </p>
<p>These truisms teach students nothing, and serve only to provide evidence of McNamara&#39;s <em>post hoc</em> justifications for his actions while under the &quot;Fog of War&quot;. He frequently contradicts himself.</p>
<p>Jean Baudrillard claims in Simulacra and Simulation that &quot;the nuclear threat created a deterrence which had no subject: it encapsulated the entirety of the world. It has the pretext of a maximal, &quot;objective,&quot; threat: total world destruction.&quot;. In some respects, this is a stupid statement: it is as uniequivocally damning of &quot;state violence&quot; as nuclear deterrence is supportive. Yet it points out the serious flaw in nuclear reasoning. If the alternative really is world destruction, wouldn&#39;t you also let things get arbitrarily bad? </p>
<p>One objection to this is that utilitarian calculations need to be made, in one context or another, and that game theory has a lot of value when applied to war, and, well, geopolitics. I would agree, and the common framing today of human problems as &quot;coordination problems&quot; agrees as well. However, the bombing of Japan was an extraordinary tragedy and event, and deserves to be treated as such. It should be treated as a fully fledged moral dilemma, not relegated to a case study in &quot;to do good you may have to engage in evil&quot;. And we should not listen to the firsthand experiences of the de facto war criminal as our primary and (only) introduction to the issue.</p>
<p>If the question is &quot;Did McNamara make the right utilitarian decision?&quot; and not &quot;Is utilitarianism the appropriate moral framework to approach this issue?&quot;, the scope of debate will inevitably be different.</p>
<p>And we also certainly shouldn&#39;t overlook the dissonance between McNamara&#39;s words and his actions. He contradicts himself multiple times. Mcnamara vacillates between two positions: a regretful one where he says &quot;proportionality should be a guideline for war&quot;, and a defensive one that immediately follows in saying, &quot;in the eyes of <em>some people,</em> the nuclear bomb was not proportional&quot;, implying he thinks that the context absolves him. And then he says &quot;we were war criminals&quot;.</p>
<p>He says that &quot;Human beings must stop killing other human beings.&quot; And that&#39;s a belief that I shared. I shared it then and I believe it even more strongly today. He then says &quot;he was prepared to do whatever killing was necessary. It&#39;s a very, very difficult position for sensitive human beings to be in. Morrison was one of those. I think I was.&quot; And McNamara hides behind the word “efficiency” -- in his eyes he’s just making bombing runs more efficient, not killing people.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that even if the U.S. had a just cause going into the war, the behavior in war -- jus in bello -- was unprecedented and extremely morally problematic. And approaching McNamara&#39;s actions from within the utilitarian framework, without giving us a chance to consider the morality of war as a whole, is immoral.</p>

<p>Traditional just war theory construes jus ad bellum and jus in bello as sets of principles, satisfying which is necessary and sufficient for a war’s being permissible. One is the justification for a war and the other is the moral action within it.</p>
<h3 id="jus-ad-bellum">jus ad bellum</h3>
<p>Jus ad bellum typically comprises the following six principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just Cause: the war is an attempt to avert the right kind of injury.</li>
<li>Legitimate Authority: the war is fought by an entity that has the authority to fight such wars.</li>
<li>Right Intention: that entity intends to achieve the just cause, rather than using it as an excuse to achieve some wrongful end.</li>
<li>Reasonable Prospects of Success: the war is sufficiently likely to achieve its aims.</li>
<li>Proportionality: the morally weighted goods achieved by the war outweigh the morally weighted bads that it will cause.</li>
<li>Last Resort (Necessity): there is no other less harmful way to achieve the just cause.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only proportionality and last resort are truly necessary, because they seem to be able to cover for the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Necessity and proportionality judgements involve weighing harms inflicted and threats averted, indeed all relevant goods and bads. The simplest way to proceed would be to aggregate the harms to individual people on each side, and call the act proportionate just in case it averts more harm than it causes, and necessary just in case no alternative involves less harm. </p>
<p>But few deontologists, and indeed few non-philosophers, think in this naively aggregative way. Instead we should weight harms (etc.) according to factors such as whether <em>the agent is directly responsible for them</em>, and whether they are intended or merely foreseen. Many also think that we can, perhaps even must, give greater importance in our deliberations to our loved ones (for example) than to those tied to us only by the common bonds of humanity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in effect, taking responsibility and social relationships into account in our utilitarian calculation. And this seems to imply that war should be for important reasons. ... the absence of a just cause makes it very difficult for a war to satisfy proportionality. </p>
<h3 id="jus-in-bello">jus in bello</h3>
<p>Jus in bello tends to agree that killing civilians is categorically bad.</p>
<ol>
<li>Discrimination: belligerents must always distinguish between military objectives and civilians, and intentionally attack only military objectives.</li>
<li>Proportionality: foreseen but unintended harms must be proportionate to the military advantage achieved.</li>
<li>Necessity: the least harmful means feasible must be used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed, traditional just war theory recognizes only two kinds of justification for war: national defence (of one’s own state or of an ally) and humanitarian intervention. What’s more, humanitarian intervention is permissible only to avert the very gravest of tragedies— ==“crimes that shock the moral conscience of mankind”== (Walzer 2006: 107).</p>
<p>Note: The wording here is very individual. There is an appeal to a tribal &quot;sense of shock&quot; at &quot;cultural&quot; (?) norms far different from ones own -- and also assumes a single moral consciousness for the entirety of mankind. In the context of a hyperbalkanized society (e.g. an interplanetary one), it would be near impossible for the existence of a single moral conscience. This begs the question: do we currently  have a single moral conscience? Can the existence of a single moral conscience exist with a difference of cultures?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blameworthy responsibility for other people’s false beliefs does seem relevant to the ethics of self- and other-defence. That said, consider an idiot who pretends to be a suicide bomber as a prank, and is shot by a police officer (Ferzan 2005; McMahan 2005c). Is killing him objectively permissible? It seems doubtful. The officer’s justified belief that the prankster posed a threat clearly diminishes the wrongfulness of killing him (Lazar 2015a). And certainly the prankster’s fault excuses the officer of any guilt. But killing the prankster still seems objectively wrong. Even if someone’s blameworthy responsibility for false beliefs could make killing him objectively permissible, most philosophers agree that many unjust combatants are not to blame for the injustice of their wars (McMahan 1994; Lazar 2010).</p>

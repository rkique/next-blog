     <p> I think that adjectives are worth keeping. Parts of speech: noun, pronoun, adjective, determiner, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection. <em>Keep nouns, adjectives, verbs? I think that could work.</em> </p>
     <p> Ok all_nouns is way too slow to search for and times out too frequently. I'll have to fix this tonight. </p>
     <hr>
     <p>
         Moving fast and breaking things. <em>Word golfing is now restricted to just nouns</em>, as tagged by nlkt/ wordnet. This brings the total space from 470k to 80k words, and greatly improves legibility at the cost of diversity. 
     </p>
     <p> I want to find an easy side project for the rest of the summer to counterbalance my creative work. I'm packed for college already, I have a couple of meetings lined up -- looking for a short research rabbit hole, book review etc.. I could spend more time on learning chinese characters. But in terms of what's useful + pertinent I should just be reviewing math. The downside of that is that it isn't easy. Maybe I'll watch math youtube videos.</p>
     <p><em>Ok, committment is to find some easy math to do.</em></p>

     <h3>August 16th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3>
     <p><em>Principle: the player should never, ever get lost and quit out of frustration. </em>Curve ramp is next to implement.</p>
     <p>So insane. eight lines of python "in" to remove verbs adverbs adjectives and whatnot and it works amazingly well.</p>
     <p>Ok, it is 6 in the morning. Time to sleep.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Just found out that I accidentally added a space to one of my filenames, which apparently gets handled on localhost but not by the server/ elastic beanstalk. So much fun and excitement this was. </p>
     <hr>
     <p>This is working beautifully. I've fixed every problem I had below.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>OH MY GOD!!</p>
     <p><em>There's a reason why using rigged prompt sets is so good, and its because when you curve towards a nearby target it's an additional filter pass for strange neighbors of the original word. </em>This means for rigged targets, the curve is able to solidify the original aesthetic while simultaneously pointing towards the target. </p>
     <h3>August 15th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3>
     <p>There's a lot of things to do... but there aren't really any things to do.</p>
     <p>I've finished my placement, and I've decided tentatively what courses I want to take first semester: CS, computational molecular bio, linalg, and my first year seminar.</p>
     <p> As always there's a bunch of things that I want to understand: macroeconomics, chinese characters, multivariable calc. I think I'm starting to get the hang of photoshop. And of course there's a ton of experiments to do for word golf. <em>But I shouldn't approach these things like a sprint in these last few days -- I'll have a lot more time to learn & to build. I'll just try to keep up some steady progress, some momentum going into the school year.</em></p>
     <p> Just off the top of my head, what needs to be done for word golf: build in a historical tree structure (not sure if this is even the right thing), build a front page with themed sets, prototype themed sets. There are several offshoot projects that I have not even gotten the chance to think through fully: little alchemy, a poetic word generator based on neighbor word topography, and the potential for (linguistic, psychological, communication) research tools based on full 200/400 word lists. </p>
     <p> I'm experimenting with displaying 90 curved words down to 7 curved words, which is much more parseable but less beautiful. I guess when you move from word to word the neighbors still form a shifting window into wordspace, which is marginally cool but not crazy enough. Balancing beauty and speed -- how do we approach that problem?  </p>
     <p> Thought: what if worse neighbors disappear as time goes on? That seems effective for maintaining skill gap and speed -- but the issue is still that a single word's location is aesthetically tied to the current word and not the target, so the homing effect is disorienting. The idea of movement is itself somewhat unnatural. </p>
     <p> A previously considered possibility: discard the target word, simply have the user navigate through a curve set up against random wordspace. </p>
     <p> What about a kind of pruning, where the user clicks to discard words which are not neighbors? That could be interesting, where the aesthetic effect increases with the players work. But that would make for a confusing mess to begin with... but aybe not more than the current confusion at the unrelatenedness of the start word. Yet its also not natural to search for unrelated words.  </p>
     <p> Or inspired by alchemy, where a word is presented and you need to find the two words which will produce it when combined semantically. That might come down to just locating neighbor words, however. </p>
     <p> Feeling right now that the current vision for a golf sport is well defined, but golf isn't good enough.
         </p>
         <p>
    <em>Then again, maybe it is. There are too many failed paths -- this can be solved by rigged prompt sets e.g. curated prompts sets drawn exclusively from 2/3 step linked neighbors, and tightening the curve when the user strays too far away. The words are not close enough or strangely linked: this can be solved with better data (in particular, excluding newspapers) and lowering the pool amount. Smaller pool = harder but more coherent. So I think small pool + rigged custom prompts could be the right way to go.</em> I have not made any attempt at rigged prompts yet, I need to test that out because it could be a game changer. It is always good to keep in mind: diversity kills intent like a firehose to a flowerbed. </p>
         
    <p>I have a lot of experiments to do :) </p>

     <h3>August 13th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3>
     <p>Labeling this as a sport is inaccurate. Capturing quick mental flights does not need to be in the context of sports, and the golf label is not easily understood. Unnecessary complexity. Going back to game means too much like Monument Valley, e.g. meditative. What do you call a new way to interact with language? An interface? media/medium? Something intricate and curious. Maybe I do need to invent a word here.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Here's the vision: 
         <ul>
             <li>word golf is beautiful when it deals with highly specific words that capture a range of well-directed and evocative concepts. See below: hideaways, sluice, shade, seance, doorknob, votive. <em>This problem of finding expressive words is exactly analogous to writing poetry. You cannot say something is "mystical" or "awe-inspiring" because adjectives are easily dulled by their use in a million of boring contexts. You have to dig deeper into the public psyche. </em> </li>
             <li>Attention is our scarcest resource and everyone hates computational poetry. "Freeplay mode" should be killed immediately. Instead, move towards releasing small sets of curated words. Incidentally, this solves the weak motivation for competition problem. </li>
             <li>The main page has to be absolutely perfect. Tile display like  <a href="https://tachyons.io/components/collections/posters/index.html">this</a> and great posters. Some word sets are free, others require an account.</li>
             <li>The word sets have to be absolutely perfect. </li>
         </ul>

     <h3> if you can read this text, you are too close</h3>
     <p> This concept (seen on the back of a truck on the highway) has a few different versions. You could imagine a memetic in a language, perhaps on a dead alien planet: "if you can decipher this text you are doomed". Probably already a SF staple but we'll see.</p>
     <h3>primacy in images </h3>
     <p>
        <p>Consider the range of images created in an attempt to express a primal message, from childhood scribbles to photorealistic renders of elaborate scenes. Neither the scribbles nor render approximates real life in their construction (the scribbles don't try to). Both are products which cannot be reused, which cannot penetrate any more than simply by viewing them. There is no practice in visual art which can achieve immortality: a monk spending their entire life illuminating a manuscript does no worse than a professional artist or animator today. If you can see the primal vision within a scribble as well as you can of a Pixar movie there is no difference in their effectiveness. </p>
        <p>The nature of the scribble is more earnestly primal, attempting to convey a truth which has not been exposed to the brittling effect of reality. Reality makes images more brittle because while it provides a medium for communication, those images never approach reality itself, due to their expressed purpose as images. Forced to choose between an idea and the impossible task of communicating it, an image will trade its primacy for a communicable approximation.</p>
        <p>But actually this is not really true. <em>Although it cannot convey its original message to an onlooker a scribble can still convey an abstract idea of itself. It can convey a communicable message of a primal message. In the failure of another person&#39;s earnest attempt to draw something exactly the way they see it, it is possible to glimpse your own attempt. </em></p>
        <p>In contrast, a photorealistic render can convey a communicable message primally, in the sense that if you did somehow think the message on screen it would appear to be that exact same primal message. Inevitably, we don&#39;t. But <em> it is an approximation of primacy in a different sense than the scribble.</em></p>
        <p>These two extremes provide a justification for all kinds of visual expression, from the painstakingly inefficient to extreme facility. As long as something is made with an authentic vision, it can convey a message that means something to someone.</p>

     <h3> locally optimized play in wordspace</h3>
     <p> Got around to building a testing engine which golfs perfectly locally, in that it will always choose the word rated with the highest similarity score to the target. The results show about 1 out of 5 runs have no reasonable path, and that most optimal runs are between 3 to 6 steps. The quality of the associations made is surprisingly good. </p>
     <p> We can see that 3 and 4 step runs dominate, with a few easy 2 step runs and hard 5 step runs. The maximum number of steps necessary is still just 7! Six degrees of separation holds for english words with 200 connections each.  </p>

             <li>Transit construction projects in the US can be on the scale of a 0.5 million dollars per meter, or 500-900 million per mile. This is the 6th most expensive in the world -- and we don't even attempt difficult tunnel projects! Many new transit projects in the US have to build the boring machines they need first. </li>
             <li>As in housing, there is no silver bullet in reducing construction costs</li>
             <li>NPR interviewee doesn't think the reason is excessive environmental regulation, but it is a problem with a lack of strong central government -- CP substack seems to agree. </li>
             <li>
                 <blockquote>So, to summarize:

                    We see almost no relationship between labor OR material costs, and construction costs for residential construction, outside of whether you’re in a western country or not.
                    
                    The US does particularly well at building homes, apartments, and other projects that have low administrative overhead or government involvement.
                    
                    The US does particularly poorly at projects with a high degree of administrative burden, government oversight, or where the government is a major stakeholder. European countries do far better by comparison.
                    
                    There’s little evidence that US homes are built to worse standards than in comparable countries.
                    
                    For residential construction, there’s little evidence that other countries have substantially more efficient construction methods that the US should adopt.
                    
                    In the US, low construction costs translate to low property prices, making the US an outlier in housing affordability on a unit-area metric.</blockquote>

                 <blockquote>If you build a robot that only handles the main workflow and can't handle any of the exceptions, you're not automating anything; you're building a convenience tool. Basically, you're removing some of the labor part of the job, but still keeping the decision making part of the job for humans.
                    This is both economically unviable and largely unpopular. You're not reducing labor costs by much, because you still need humans around. And workers lose control over their job, and have to "work around" the robot's limitations. Instead of being freed up to do more work, they become babysitters of machines that they have to oversee so it doesn't mess up everything.
                    This is why partial robotic systems don't really exist; either it's a nifty tool that speeds up a small repeatable process of your work, or it's building the entire house.</blockquote>

     <h3>August 4th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3>
     <p> A note for later: finding difficult words should be easy with an automated run of the hacked version. Just prefire for potential targets and see if it reaches it within 100 runs -- if not, then there is a rift in the local geography. For example, I just tried to get to "ring" but even using the closest neighbor every time traps you between "belts" and "rings". </p>
     <hr>
     <p> I know what to do next.</p>
         
     <p>Right now the biggest challenge is that you can wander off course and get completely lost. I can do one of two things: first, implement a safety net ("It looks like you've wandered too far off course, would you like to be taken back?"). However, what is really getting me excited is the second idea. I've been playing with a hacked version, which sorts wordspace by how close they are to the target word. This makes the first link always the best one. Now, instead of simply presenting the closest neighbors of a word, we can present a randomized selection from a curve: one from the top 3 closest <i>to the target</i>, five from the top 10 closest <i>to the target</i>, 30 from the top 50, etc. This will make the game much faster, and hopefully highlight the skill differentiator in a better way than before. Now you don't really need to worry about getting closer to the target with each stroke -- but you want to get there as fast as possible. And some of the options will be much, much better than others. For example homonyms are freakishly good. They're like portals. They let you to wormhole across wordspace, go from a part like fish to a part like musical instruments.  </p>
     <hr>
     <p>I just realized that I haven't actually installed Elastic Beanstalk on my new computer, which, from past experience, means it will take at least a day to build again. Also apparently my version is getting deprecated? Sigh.</p>
     <hr>
     <p> Here's another good example of optimal play. Starting from fish and going to clarinet is a difficult run, rated 8.6 on the similarity-log scale. But by making use of a homonym along the way, it can be done in just 6.2 seconds and 3 jumps. </p>
     <pre>
        Go from fish to clarinet 8.6
        trout 0.0s
        bass 1.3s
        clarinet 6.2s
        Way to go! You reached clarinet in 6.2s and 3 jumps.

    <h3>Online dictionaries </h3>
    <p> Update: I feel stupid, just search github english words and you can find a bunch. I already did this a while back, not sure why I didn't implement spellchecking then. I think <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt">this</a> is the best one with 479k words and 5k stars.  </p>
    <p> It's surprisingly hard to find online dictionaries for determining whether or not something is a valid english word. <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/">SCOWL</a> seems like the best thing I could find -- it's upstream of pyenchant which they don't seem to mention anywhere except a single github thread.</p>

<p>
    The site has been reverted to its original state, prioritizing the blog above the visualization (which you can find on the right side!). However, the workflow is still much improved with editing in VSCODE and pushing changes to a git repo. The tradeoff is that I lose AWStats, the benefit is that I don't actually have to pay for hostgator anymore.
</p>
<h3>June 12th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span> </h3>
<p> So much done today! </p>
<p>Spent the morning getting timestamps working, using a helper utility to scrape git last modified dates for each markdown file. That way when the files are built on the server the date is the correct one.  </p>
<p>Along with some vital UI upgrades I got a skeleton 3D canvas set up within Next.js with three-react/fiber <a href="https://elegant-minsky-b916c9.netlify.app">https://elegant-minsky-b916c9.netlify.app</a></p>
<p>I also finally got around to setting up an SSH key for github, so now I can push changes live really quick.</p>
<br>
<p>Spent the evening on <a href="word.golf">word.golf</a></p>
<p>now there are routes for every english word! Try word.golf/staircase or word.golf/mango </p>
<p>After some deliberation I removed the timer from the main interface. It's distracting and prevents people from exploring. Might reintroduce it for specific modes though.</p>
<p>I also implemented copy to clipboard, connected git to github, and fit more words. </p>
<h3>June 10th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span> </h3>
<p>I graduated high school today, which should warrant at least a medium amount of self reflection. </p>
<p>First off -- I&#39;m experiencing an increasing amount of friction with the tools I use. This includes</p>
<ul>
<li>Most annoyingly the &quot;f&quot; and backspace key caps on my keyboard have flaked off. This has resulted in an unnecessary rewiring of those key locations in my mind so that I can hit them right on the nub.</li>
<li><p>My Obsidian vault, which has gradually devolved from a well kept garden of school notes to a zoo of different sized thoughts. I will need to go back and categorize my writing and reflections more carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to find a way to immediately publish notes from my vault. Should I pay for Obsidian Publish? ($8/month, $96/ year which is a large expense but not impossible to get). </li>
<li>The thing is, I don&#39;t even use a lot of markdown features. I just want links, lists, and headings to persist. to be honest I&#39;ve gradually stopped using links due to site display prio. RIP zettlekasten</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>My computer is running out of space and frequently overheats or fails to charge.</p>
</li>
<li>My site has gone from a list of projects to an unstable scatter of clickable things and a huge one-page blog. Editing this blog.html file is becoming more and more unsustainable. <ul>
<li>How to solve this?</li>
<li>reimagine the main page to automate pushing objects to a scrollable display without three.js. This scrollable display can be done with css/ tachyons, although to be honest it&#39;s not that interesting. </li>
<li>How do I present primarily visual projects aside primarily textual projects in an engaging way?</li>
<li>The current approach of just taking screenshots of bits of text to paste onto the three.js canvas is terrible. I need to find a way to automate this. I&#39;m reluctant to use / adapt an existing static site generator: maybe I can build one? This is a fun side programming project that would result in a unique sort of website.<ul>
<li>How to present my interests/ organize knowledge efffectively<ul>
<li>What ARE my interests anyways</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when in doubt, simplify. there are two essential projects for thought-sanity:<pre><code>  - Clean Up Day: spend a few hours cleaning up <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> obsidian vault. This involves elaborating <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> past thoughts <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> getting more recent thoughts <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> so <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">isn't</span> all super outdated notes <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> linear algebra.
  - Using markdowntohtml.com generator works FINE. That <span class="hljs-keyword">isn't</span> actually <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">real</span> problem.

I have a good idea <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> what <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> new site should look like actually. Explorer, sparse retrofuturistic details. Keep <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> omnidirectional navigation. Create groups <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> display. Ditch <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> three.js
      - This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> a ton <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> work though
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes to publish / write/ Books to ReAd: Reason and Violence (a condensed summary of jean-paul sartre&#39;s writing), thoughts on Camus&#39;s the Fall, ...</p>
<p>And then we have our word.golf project. I&#39;m going to be pretty busy.</p>
<p>I have never found someone my age doing something more interesting, to me, than the things I work on. Although I'm not comfortable being artist-first, or anything adjacent to "indie game developer", I still have what might be considered a fundamental delusion: my own creative interests lie ready to be picked up by the general public. </p>
<p>But why not -- it&#39;s exciting enough!</p>

<p>Another nice chunk of progress made on word.golf tonight. Now stores a "history item" in LocalStorage which has target_word and wordArray properties.</p>
<p>I've also switched from Jinja-based logic to javascript logic; the buttons are now dynamically generated. The side effect of this is that the data passed from python is now in the form of JSON.</p>
<p>Next steps: Completion logic (total time, ↻start again which gets a new target_word). Display words and time as user strings them together, and store time in a timeArray. </p>
<p>This is like 1923821 times more fun than the original idea lol</p>

<p><em>Heroes</em> by Franco Bifo Berardi attempts to connect the Internet, nationalist movements, and mass murderers like James Holmes vis a vis <em>Joker</em>. It has promising lines of thought but is ultimately far too academic. The words are muddled ("financial capitalism" and "fractalized time") and the book lacks a real unifying theme.
There is something very important here though to be explored between social spectacle & violent rage.

<p>Four runthroughs of the new mechanism. The first word is always taken from a list of 1,000 most common english words. The next word, illustrating the "correct" path, is then a random choice from the 10 nearest neighbors of the last one.</p>
<p>Problems: most noticeably the existence of fragments in the GLOVE vocabulary. To be removed. Also cycling back, and the existence of very similar words e.g. Judge and Judges.  </p>
<p> Otherwise it's quite exciting. The idea is that running through something of this length should take maybe 30 seconds max, as the user makes quick instinctive decisions as to which word is more related. </p>
<img src="https://eric-xia.com/images/word_ex.PNG" style="width: 100%">
<p>Current idea: choose between closest neighbor and random. Choosing correctly takes you on a walk through word-space.</p>

<p>A trick that really works: </p>
<p>Do one easy task and one hard task at the same time. This way, you balance out any momentary frustration with a known reward simply for existing. </p>
<p>ex: doing homework while waiting for something to bake, writing on long car rides, reading while brushing teeth</p>
<p>you can do this everyday by writing in the margins while reading, or recording your screen as you work. Producing something motivates you no matter what.</p>

<h3>May 14th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3>
<p>After 23 successive deployments and 12 hours the app finally got onto heroku (briefly, before crashing out of memory): <a href="http://word-golf.herokuapp.com/golf">http://word-golf.herokuapp.com/golf</a>. I need 1gb RAM which is $50/mo. I am going to look into switching to AWS elastic beanstalk. Either way I am glad i will never have to go through this again.</p>
<p>mistakes I made while deploying:</p>
<ul>
    <li>using backslashes \\ for specifying file path (assume windows specific). forward / worked</li>
    <li>not putting the entry point (wsgi.py) outside of the rest of the application folder. This ends up being necessary because the line ". import routes" in create_app needs to know there exists a parent folder?</li>
    <li>Didn't even have a wsgi.py file for a long time. unfortunately that's the file that actually creates the app.</li>
    <li>specifying the wrong versions of dependencies, and not using a virtual environment from the beginning.</li>
    <li>the Procfile, which specifies the entry point to the app for Heroku, has a really weird format: "web: gunicorn wsgi:app". The variables are on the left side :| </li>
    <li>I kept on setting __init__.py as the entry point, not wsgi.py because it does fine locally with "flask run"</li>
    <li>happily I did not download 6 gb Visual Studio C++ when gensim asked me to. Instead I abandoned my attempt at making a virtual environment  </li>
    <li>dotenv, which lets you configure flask with a .env file, wouldn't install so I removed it </li>
    <li>forgot to specify modules in requirements.txt</li>
    <li>didn't have requirements.txt in the root folder</li>
</ul>
Overall though this was a hard-won victory. I am ready to continue
<hr>
I was so naive.

<p>the MVP is deploying to heroku right now! I have saved the login auth work for when I have more than 0 hours of sleep.</p>

<hr>
<p></p>Coding. I have a MVP and it is so fast. This is so exciting
<p>I also decided to put some effort into an artist statement for the senior show. It comes off as overly angsty & dense but who cares. I am listening to Killing in the Name </p>
<h3>Eric's senior year artist statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to close the distance between art and daily life, and the three projects I&#39;m proudest of from this year each try to do this.</p>

<img src="https://www.eric-xia.com/images/paperclip real.PNG" style="width: 100%">
<br><br>
<p>The first one visualizes the possible uses for a paperclip. 
Taking 3,001 responses to a research study that asked its participants how many uses of a paperclip they could think of (Guilford&#39;s Alternative Uses Test), I searched a stock icon library and got about 600 unique representations (fishhook, dart, slinky, clothespin...). Collectively, these images are a testament to both human ingenuity and the number of roles a paperclip can take on.</p>

<br><br>
<p>The second is a 37-minute long video of me shoveling a pile of gravel in my backyard. It asks the question: What is the nature of work? </p>
<p>In the knowledge economy of today, work is about ideas. You brainstorm projects, create proof of concepts, propose solutions to problems. These ideas are the products of today&#39;s knowledge economy, the proof-of-work for knowledge workers. </p>
<p>Yet our traditional image of work is informed by manual labor. Moving rocks, digging ditches, carting gravel: our mental models for work are based in physical action and incremental progress. It is measurable and quantifiable. By highlighting this video as a creative work, the video frames manual labor as knowledge work. By juxtaposing these two radically different kinds of work, I aim to reduce to absurdity the quantification of creativity in today&#39;s knowledge economy.</p>
<br><br>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fGuMgOS7NNiPeiouol7gdxj1l9ochOyN/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<br><br>
<p>The third and final project is an existential one. It centers around a single mental image:  two Youtube videos playing at the same time, &quot;Lofi hip hop beats to study/relax to&quot; and &quot;15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes.&quot; The resulting sound is chaotic and unsettling.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The lofi music -- interchangeable, forgettable, soothing -- is a coping mechanism, a dream. It is a distraction from the Sisyphean nature of the sorting algorithm.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The sorting algorithm embodies work, chaos brought to order over and over, representing a life&#39; spent in a fast-moving field, perhaps software programming. Databases, applications, interfaces: they create a temporary semblance of order, but to what end? They will be soon replaced, their replacements replaced. All that is left for the worker is the time itself, living in an uneasy truce between the music and the work.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Adding to this theme is a wilderness survival guide, a wall calendar, The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins, a potted plant, assorted change, a freshly sliced orange, a wallet, car keys, a statistics textbook -- and the Dewey Decimal System, a system for categorizing the entirety of human knowledge into a series of answers to ten questions we don&#39;t actually have the answers to, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we organize information?</li>
<li>Who am I?</li>
<li>How did I get here?</li>
<li>Who are the people around me?</li>
<li>How can I communicate with others?</li>
<li>How can I explain the world around me?</li>
<li>How can I control the world around me?</li>
<li>How can I enjoy my free time?</li>
<li>What are the stories of our lives?</li>
<li>What was the world like in the past?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on Consumer Society, Jean Baudrillard (1970)</h3>
<p>More reading notes. From <em>Selected Writings</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-bad-part">the bad part</h4>
<p>Baudrillard describes consumerism and the modern grocery store (in a section called &quot;profusion and displays&quot;. This part is not good. </p>
<p>He is attempting to criticize the &quot;endless imagery of feast&quot; and the meaningless choice, but in my opinion what he describes are either trivial marketing tricks (&quot;We can observe that objects are never offerred for consumption in an absolute disarray. In certain cases they can mimic disorder to better seduce, but they are always arranged to trace out directive paths.&quot;) or genuinely positive things -- its particularly funny when he says that <blockquote>our markets, our shopping avenues and malls mimic a new-found nature of prodigious fecundity. Those are our Valleys fo Canaan where flows, instad of milk and honey, streams of neon on ketchup and plastic.</blockquote> Baudrillard conveniently omits the fact that supermarkets carry milk and honey. What does he even mean by a stream of neon on ketchup and plastic?</p>
<p>Baudrillard dismisses progressive principles. He says that there is a &quot;fable&quot; of the man who once lived in Scarcity but now lives in the Society of Affluence. However, in economics, &quot;Among all the unknowns of economic science, needs are the most persistently obscure&quot;. This hints that consumerism does not fulfill human needs. This is what skeptics see as the consistent failing of [[Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker]] type books: the [[hedonic treadmill]].</p>
<h4 id="the-good-part">the good part</h4>
<p>&quot;The beauty of the surroundings is a precondition for a happy life&quot;</p>
<p>Baudrillard says something which I feel is pretty insightful which is that the all-in-one unity of the shopping mall and the futuristic city (think Northgate mall, or Northline Village,  or any ice cream + theater + condos + &quot;market&quot; development) really prioritizes perpetual shopping above all else. This is akin to the casino which opens up a buffet to get gamblers to stay for longer. </p>
<p>The exact aesthetic values of the future which we are raised with are very important. Looking at films like Tomorrowland for guidance, you will find that classic utopian visions have large green open spaces and white organic skyscrapers are at the forefront -- a future which implies reconnecting with our biological nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, similar &amp; benign-seeming futures advertised on development placards feature the &quot;promenade&quot;, the &quot;commons&quot;: these place consumers at the panoptic center of attention, the eyes of storefronts and in the eyes of others. If there is nature, it is always subservient to man and subservient to consumption.</p>
<p>Baudrillard: Pleasure is now the citizen&#39;s duty. This is the principle of the maximization of existence by the mutliplication of contacts and relations, by the extensive use of signs and objects, and by the systematic exploitation of all the possibilities of pleasure.</p>
<p>Pleasure &amp; desire is equivalent to the traditional Marxist constraint of labor &amp; production. ... <em>[Modern man] will be gently and instantly reminded that he has no right not to be happy.</em></p>
<p>The puritan morality has warped into the FUN morality, whose imperative is enjoyment and the compelete exploitation of all the possibilities of being thrilled experiencing pleasure, and being gratified.</p>
<p>Baudrillard sees credit as &quot;the systematic socioeconomic indotrination of forced economicizing and an economic calculus for generations of consumers who, in a life of subsistence, would have been unexploitable as a force of consumption.&quot;. </p>
<p>Again drawing parallels between traditional marxist theory and consumer theory, Baudrillard claims that the current &quot;indoctrination into systematic and organized consumption is the equivalent and the extension, in the twentieth century, of the great indoctrination of the rural populations into industrial labor, which occurred throughout the nineteenth century.&quot;</p>
<p>Calling progressive thinking the &quot;ideology of consumption&quot;, Baudrillard derides the idea that some decisive &quot;human revolution&quot; separates the Age of Production from the Age of Consumption. Instead, Production and Consumption are one and the same, aiding the expansion of productive forces worldwide. </p>
<p>Citing a quote from Eisenhower on how the government&#39;s role should merely be to encourage consumer spending... Eisenhower implies that consumption, not being directly imposed, could effectively replace taxation as a social levy.</p>
<p>The consumer is consripted and mobilized as a laborer, consumption is social labor, the consumer is the Universal Being at the end of the human species the People are venerated by democracy the same way the Public are venerated by business: given that they do not choose to interfere politically or socially.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-on-consumer-society">thoughts on consumer society</h4>
<p>I feel that this section falls flat. The power of consumption, of fulfilling material needs such as buying a new TV or car, is far overemphasized. There is a contradiction in that YOLO-- the pleasure morality, the morality which ostensibly fuels spending on material goods -- actually supports saving. Because saving for retirement, for experiences is so necessary and drilled into the minds of millenials/ gen Zrs, and because people would rather buy TIME with money (anti-work movement, four day work weeks) than material improvement, our consumption is not Baudrillard&#39;s.</p>
<p>Instead our consumption seems increasing fueled by cultural affirmation. Lying on the empty floor of an American Room staring into a phone after doing the bare minimum, what we crave is direct validation through affirmation,  infinite and instantaneous X-tok subcultural affirmations as opposed to the friction-laden and socially dubious act of material consumption. </p>
<p>The idea of the &quot;niche internet microcelebrity&quot; and creation as consumption supports this same idea, that what Tiktok is good at doing is creating subcultures, the infrastructure for two-way validations in likes and followers. It blurs the gap between creator and consumer more than any other phenomenon to date.</p>

<h3 id="ivyleague"> Note on "Break up the Ivy League Cartel"</h3>
<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/break-up-the-ivy-league-cartel">https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/break-up-the-ivy-league-cartel</a>.</p>
<p>BIG is a very well known Substack centered around monopoly power, and they recently had a guest writer write about how the "Ivy League Cartel" threatens American democracy. While it is clear that the selection process at elite universities is flawed, the premise of this article is very wrong. </p>
  The exclusivity of the Ivy League is not wrecking the democratization of education, because what differentiates Ivy League schools is not the quality of education. 
<p>Something that is common knowledge for college applicants is that the quality of education does not differ meaningfully between many schools. The value of elite universities is college experience, connections, and prestige. </p>
This following quote is especially problematic. It implies that the increased selectivity of elite colleges is somehow directly responsible for a decline in the quality of public education:

<blockquote>
There is no way that I know of to have truly democratic elections without widely available and high-quality public education. As everyone knows, the consolidation of wealth by elite, mostly private, schools has gone hand-in-hand with damaging political campaigns that have weakened even the country’s greatest public universities, such the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the University of California-Berkeley, for example.

<h3 id="survival">the simulation of self-sufficiency in survival fiction is an existential plea</h3>
<p>Something not given enough attention is the link between survival literature (boxcart children, my side of the mountain, gary paulsen&#39;s hatchet, bear grylls ... chris mccandles?) and the existential/absurd perspective. To kids growing up who the rules of society didn't seem to make sense, survival fiction provides a welcome escape. </p>
<p>This basic human desire for simplicity (which is the same as confronting the existential, which is the same as denial of death) is reflected in either an attempt for RATIONALIZATION (le corbusier desire for legibility aka <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">seeing as a state</a>) or an attempt for IRRATIONALIZATION, fatalistic detachment through an artificial return to wilderness survival. The first is the dismissal of the unexplainable from the world, the second is disassociating the unexplainable from oneself. </p>
<p>Both are pleas for the world to make sense.</p>

<h3 id="meaning">A response to "Ultimate Meaning: We Don’t Have It, We Can’t Get It, and We Should Be Very, Very Sad" by Rivka Weinberg</h3>

<p>
View the paper here in the Journal of Controversial Ideas: <a href="https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/1/1/132">https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/1/1/132</a></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is pointless. That’s not okay. I show that. I argue that a point is a valued end and that, as agents, it makes sense for us to want our efforts and enterprises to have a point. Valued ends provide justifying reasons for our acts, efforts, and projects. I further argue that ends lie separate from the acts and enterprises for which they provide a point. Since there can be no end external to one’s entire life since one’s life includes all of one’s ends, leading and living one’s life as a whole cannot have a point. Finally, I argue that since we live our lives and structure our living­a­human­life efforts both in parts and as a whole, it is fitting to be sad to recognize that leading and living a life is pointless. My discussion helps make sense of the literature that frequently talks around this topic but often does so vaguely and indirectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot possibly have a point to leading a life because valued ends (points) are external to the projects toward which they are directed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some strong arguments, esp. about many abstract/altruistic values as delaying the problem of life having a point. But I don&#39;t agree at all because I don&#39;t think that &quot;having a point&quot; for life is the same as &quot;having a point&quot; for an action within life.</p>
<p>I think Rivka&#39;s response to the category mistake objection is fatally flawed.</p>
<p>This is the category mistake objection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We might consider asking for the point of life, or being sad that there isn’t one, to be a category mistake, akin to asking, “When is a potato?” or being sad that your baby has a name but not a number, or that your nose is neither odd nor even.</p>
<p>Seeking the “when” of a potato or the oddness or evenness of a nose is incoherent; potatoes and noses are not the kinds of things that have times or oddness/evenness. It is incoherent to demand that of them and nonsensical to bemoan the fact that your nonsensical demands cannot be met. When we ask what the point of life is and are sad to discover that life can’t have a point, are we making a category mistake? Are we nonsensically bemoaning an incoherence?</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>And this is her defense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think so. Leading a human life is an effort or enterprise we all engage in, just as we engage in many other projects within our human lives. It can then come as a disappointing surprise to note that, unlike many other of our purposeful enterprises, leading life itself cannot have a point. Asking whether life is pointless is not incoherent—we understand the question and are capable of sensibly answering it; we just may not like the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strength of the category mistake objection is that it says, NOT finding a point does not make something pointless. The attribute of having a &quot;point&quot; does not apply to life itself when our idea of what a &quot;point&quot; could constitute is informed entirely by the points of actions within life. <br> <br> She never answers this.</p>
<p>Because of this category mistake, I think that &quot;the point&quot; for life as a whole is not its effect, as is &quot;the point&quot; for individual actions, but rather the point is to live stories/ have experiences which are timeless. The ends of life as a whole, to the extent that we engage in life as an effort or enterprise <em>of its own</em> (which, again, is not the same way we engage in individual actions), are timeless.</p>
<p>Stepping back a bit, my own view (which I think is fairly conventional) is that closed loops of value make individual actions intrinsically meaningful, and all of life is composed of these individual actions, meaning that living as a whole is meaningful. This objection, akin to dismissing Zeno&#39;s Paradox (Rivka is saying how can anything move? Of course things can move!!), is also addressed in a section titled &quot;The Fallacy of Composition&quot;. She says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might object that seeking a point to living at all is an instance of the fallacy of composition, i.e., of attributing to the whole what is true of the parts. <b>But, as argued, life is an effort or enterprise that we engage in both in parts and as an effort or enterprise of its own.</b> It therefore makes sense for us to want that effort to have a point because it is the valued ends toward which our efforts are directed that serve to help us justify or makes sense of those efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor objection to the above: Life itself is not an effort of its own. Every effort within life is an action within it. </p>
<p>However, as far as life itself must be construed to have some kind of overarching aim (and I agree that there is some expectation in this sense, although I still don&#39;t think the attribute of &quot;having a point&quot; applies in the same way), the best argument against this that I can think of comes from this quote from <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/stanislaw-lems-reflections-childhood/">Stanislaw Lem&#39;s Reflections on the Objects of His Childhood Home</a>: <em>“Each experience has its weight, its authority, which does not admit of argument and depends only on itself.”</em> </p>
<p><em>The purpose which we extract from our life structure is not due to its effect</em>. It is not causal in the sense of an individual valued end or &quot;point&quot; immediately following it in time. Instead, the value, which Rivka acknowledges as well, comes from what is termed the &quot;narrative trajectory of human life&quot;, or what I will term the story which stands independent of time. While a story takes the form of a cause and an effect, the <em>value of the story</em> is akin to aesthetic/experience, and is detached from time. Timeless fairy tales, archetypal/prototypical figures etc.</p>
<p>The reason that our own expectation-fulfillment drive for life-as-story are not the same kind of goal as eating five tomatoes (a fulfillable drive) is because our own experiences are in the frame of our life as a whole. &quot;I want to be the kind of person who goes skydiving before they die&quot; is a continual, life-long drive which will NOT be fulfilled by going skydiving.</p>
<p>One possible objection to this claim I just made, &quot;that the value of the life is in living stories&quot;, is that striving to appear a certain way is a fundamentally a social phenomenon. In response, I actually think that this value is mostly convincing <em>yourself</em> that you are a certain kind of person or a figure within another narrative. And that you will be until the day you die.</p>
<p>(With this way of thinking of living stories as having timeless value, I am taking the stance that all of this value is human defined. Without the knowledge of life stories this point for life would not exist, perhaps in a hypothetical Edenic paradise)</p>
<p>This idea of timeless story value also answers the defense against the &quot;Everyday Meaning Objection&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recall: if I work as a lawyer fighting for civil rights, for example, the point of my efforts is justice, which is part of my Everyday Meaning. But justice cannot serve as the point of leading my life, even if we think of our overall efforts as necessary conditions for my Everyday Meaningful fight for justice, as I will notice by imagining justice achieved,—then what? What is the point of the rest of my life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The continual drive to be someone who fights for justice is the Universal Meaning behind the Everyday Meaning of justice. And that won't stop. Preserving the story of your life requires constant vigilance.</p>
<p>To summarize: Rivka&#39;s whole argument for the pointlessness of life is based on the point being external to the action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The point of building a hut, like all points, will lie outside the hut, as we have noted. But there’s nothing external to your life to serve as the point of leading and living it because your life includes your whole damn life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is something external! Externality only involves time (the &quot;after&quot;) when the desired state (of your family, of politics, of the world) in question are themselves subject to time. When the objects themselves, stories/experiences, are independent of time, they can be an external valued end in themselves without being subject to time; without coming &quot;after&quot;. Life can and does have an external point because the point of life is not causal like individual actions in life.</p>

<h3 id="tiktok">Response: Kneeling Bus's <a href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/157-this-must-be-the-place">"This Must Be the Place"</a></h3>
<p> When I originally read this piece I was impressed by the way it encapsulated my feelings of disenchantment about the relationship of the Internet to the physical world. </p>
<p>In particular, the following quotes stuck out to me. The first is the recognition that suburbia is not a fleeting circumstance to be transcended, but remains the defining aesthetic in America:</p>
<blockquote> If you grow up in the suburbs, a familiar experience is going over to a friend’s house for the first time and recognizing its layout as identical to that of another friend’s house you’ve already visited, if not your own house...This experience of recurrence mirrors other patterns that predominate in suburban (and increasingly, urban) environments: the ready-made familiarity of chain stores and restaurants that you’ve already encountered elsewhere, only distinguished by slight variations, appearing in similar clusters throughout a metropolitan area. </blockquote>
The second describes what Kneeling Bus calls "post-spatial space" (a term I personally don't like), and is from Paul Ford's <a href="https://medium.com/message/the-american-room-3fce9b2b98c5"> The American Room</a>: </p>
<blockquote> “The people dancing and talking and singing in beige rooms with 8' ceilings are surrounded by standards, physically and online. Technological standards like HTML5 also allow us to view web pages and look at video over the Internet. All of their frolic is bounded by a set of conventions that are essentially invisible yet define our national physical and technological architecture. Their dancing, talking bodies are the only non-standardized things in the videos.
</blockquote>
Finally, this last quote paints a dystopian vision of the future:
<blockquote>Earlier this month a house in Santa Monica, currently on the market for $5 million, became available to TikTok influencers, who can apply to spend two hours filming amid its pool and amenities as long as they help market the house in their videos.The process by which Airbnb transformed shelter into a liquid commodity might similarly transform content creation sites, which is to say that humans and content will soon have to compete for housing.</blockquote>
<p> Here are several (pretty convincing) defenses of Instagram/Tiktok in response, mostly from my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/claire._y/">Claire Yang</a>:</p>
<p><em>This hunt for common experience is not a bad thing. Instagrammability results in cute cafes and pink brick walls. Is it really a dystopia when your life resembles a pinterest board?. People use Pinterest as a way to intentionally work towards having their life mimic internet pictures. They explicitly agree to this and enjoy it.</em></p>
<p><em>Fashion isn't frozen. Tiktok content creators understand homogenization better than outsiders and strive to avoid it. They are not trapped into anything. Much of internet culture is making fun of basic and outdated attempts to fit in. </em></p>
<p><em>Saying that "humans and content will soon have to compete for housing" is hyperbole. The interests of rich influencers have always trumped poorer people, and different types of buildings serve different purposes.</em></p>
<p><em>Lastly, caring about something like the American Room is elitist. Beige 8' rooms look rather nice. (the recognition of its existence is good though)</em></p>
<p>I'm not sure if the author meant to come off as negative (he does seem to strive to be impartial). At any rate, I still really like the article for what it brings attention to. </p>

<h3>The Universe is a dream dreamed by a single dreamer where all the dream characters dream too</h3>
The Tumblr crowd is not so different from the Hacker News crowd. Both draw people who are intensely fascinated with the texture of life, mostly introverts. Then I think the (usually) male impulse for self-sacrifice causes the two to diverge. <br><br>

I can't help but see engineers, who are predominately male, as aesthetics altruists. They are the only ones who get to build cities, bridges, to set the scene for human life, but always at the curse of knowledge which makes their creations banal for themselves. That is the irony to their idealism: at the end of the promise of the true realization of their dreams they end up having to sacrifice them, no longer able to see anything other than plumbing and shear loads. <br> <br>

In this sense I guess you cannot really make something for yourself. In the process of making you are inevitably drawn into a different, sadder understanding of your creation than the consumer. The architect of the temple can never be the excited visitor whom he designs for. No one wants to do the work, we all want to live in worlds of other peoples' making, for life to happen to us; but without acts of aesthetic altruism, of self-sacrifice, none of it would ever be real. <br>

<h3>seek trivial inconveniences</h3>
A classic idea from the LessWrong archives is "beware trivial inconveniences". Scott Alexander writes about how formidable the Great Firewall of China had always seemed, and then how surprised he was to find, once he visited, that all it took was twenty minutes to set up an internet proxy to get around it. This seemingly minor inconvenience was all it took to prevent the majority of the population from accessing the rest of the web. <br><br>
The natural corollary of this idea, then, is to <i>seek</i> trivial inconveniences. Solving the easy problems probably get you farther than you think.

<blockquote>...The majority of the reviewed proposed approaches are not equipped to cater for traditional limitations, such as negation effects or ironic phenomena in text. <br>
 <br>

: Addresses the automatic detection of sarcasm and irony by introducing an ensemble approach based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), that takes into account several classifiers according to their reliabilities and their marginal probability predictions.  <br>

Results show that not all the features are equally able to characterise sarcasm and irony, whereby sarcasm is better characterised by Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, and ironic statements by pragmatic particles (such as emoticons and emphatic/onomatopoeic expressions, which represent those linguistic elements typically used in social media to convey a particular message). <br>

The authors found out “that a humorous tweet is 76.7% likely to also be sarcastic”, whereas “sarcastic tweets are only 26.2% likely to be humorous”. Future work is required on the connection between sarcasm and humour.

Books that I read (partway) over spring break:
<ul>
    <li>Materialism and the Mind/Body Problem // edited by David Rosenthal</li>
    <li>Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzche</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>
some interesting ideas from mind/body problem (don't have the book with me): one strong objection I didn't consider to the identification of mental states with brain events is the lack of spatiality; a mental state is disembodied while a brain event clearly happens in space (e.g. in an MRI scan!). It's not clear to me that mental states are necessarily disembodied -- they can have environmental triggers or necessarily involve 3d space (imagining climbing a tree etc.). There are many strange Identity Theories, which reveal how ambiguous "is" really can be. <br><br>

I think I trust philosophy significantly more now though. No one is caught up on the semantics of "is". They are simply saying, if we define "is" as this condition is it true? If we define "is" as this <i>other special</i> condition is it still true? As <a href="http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/agnes-callard/">Agnes Callard</a> says
<blockquote>"we never want to hit the point in any conversation where we throw up our hands and say 'isn’t that just a matter of how you use the words'. I think, contra Wittgenstein, that philosophy is what makes it impossible for language to go on holiday."

Working on a "probability quenching" blog post which is related to my college application process.

    <li>25% thru HSK list 2</li>
    <li>read 100 pages of <em>reamde</em> by neal stephenson, got bored. The story is interesting (palette drift! simulacrum! seattle!) but excessive setup lost me</li>
    <li>(mostly) read the <em>birth of tragedy</em>, thus spoke zarathustra by nietzche. notes to publish</li>
    <li>to read: virtue ethics</li>
    <li>TOC problem set 2</li>

    <li>gravel pile work has been done</li>
    <li>and of course college</li>
</ul>
<br>
What can be said about college admissions and how can it be done without seeming entitled? <br>
Probability quenching, fake college site, quantitative analogies, evolutionary analogies, agent models, boring  boring boring<br>
Must find good project for senior arts show.

Sorry about accidentally deleting this page!<br><br>
Fixed it by copy pasting all of the entries from Updately. Admittedly there were only 6 but thanks Samson! <br><br>
 <ul>
     <li>20 pages into Society of the Spectacle for fun </li>
     <li> IEP entries: descartes, slavoj zizek. I'm beginning to prepare for a MUN conference </li>
     <li>50 pages into Simulacra and Simulation, will hopefully put up nice notes sometime </li>
 </ul>
 In other news: I graduated from the HSK Level 1 Word List, about 150 chinese characters! Now for Level 2<br><br>
And now by writing this blog post I'm procrastinating on my Sipser Chapter 2 reading, Duolingo, and Physics homework.
<br><br><br><br>

<h3>February 20th <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3><br><br><br><br>
Spent all of today/yesterday on the lateral thinking project and got a working version up on heroku.<br><br>

Nice to get familiar with virtual environments/ git/ flask. Excited to keep developing -- its an interesting niche as accessible interactive NLP. I feel there's potential for a real tool for thinking, not simply an organizational or aesthetic tool. And it's fun and conceptually interesting. Todo is converting the similarity metrics to graphs in JS and adding time limits. And finding additional creative indicators.

<h3>February 17th<span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3> Had a nice midwinter break so far.<br><br>

Finished The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera, 5/5 stars. Go read it<br><br>
Read The Dispossessed by Ursula Le Guin aka "anti-ayn rand". Liked it a lot, puts forth a very realistic view of nonauthoritarian communism. 4/5 stars<br><br>
Did Theory of Computation problem set 1<br><br>
Got a skeleton MongoDB + Next.js integration set up for Synplifier! I have a long way to go but all the data is now imported with database. Now I can really get into rewriting my code in React, hurray<br><br>
to read: Against Method & Structure of SR still February 12 <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span> <br><br><br><br> 新年快乐!<br><br>
did homework<br><br>
Fixed the three.js navigation some more, added contacts<br><br>
Read The Atlas of Radical Cartography, a little book of 10 essays. TIL there was quite the extensive mafia trash collection cartel in NYC up until the 1990s.<br><br>
There was one map/essay which took the idea of the water cycle and made it much more detailed which was very interesting. Apparently, wastewater-to-tap water supply does not exists anywhere in the US. Also, many municipal drains just go to the ocean. Theme is that there's clearly a huge disconnect between the abstract manifestation/knowledge of the water cycle and the actual perceived social meaning-- stemming from the idea that Nature is thought of as abstracted from our actual surroundings.
<br><br>
Finished english essay on technopessimism: It's not anything super new, just a personal perspective. Perhaps the most resonant part for me is artificial creation, or creation-as-consumption. + web dev now vs the internet 1990s, how tiktok convinces everyone that they can become creators rather than consumers, selling that dream. +GravelHacks/ pascal's wager, bayesian probabilities/probability quenching. +easily imaginable situations are given more weight
<br><br>
built up a side project which quantifies lateral creative thinking (aka Alternative Uses Test) through use of word vector representations. Should be relatively quick through Gensim + Flask. Flask is amazing btw
<br><br>
<h3>February 7 <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3> <br><br><br><br>
Today was productive but also quite uninspiring. It was briefly sunny.<br><br>

Finished reading Topeka School. 4/5 stars, probably the most contemporary book I've read in several months.<br><br>

Read and took notes on 1.3 in Theory of Computation. There is a ton of formalism -- I'm worried that I tend to regard the wrong things as trivial: just because I took a ton of notes on syntax early on doesn't mean that I'm going to get a better grasp of concepts. But then again maybe that is what I'm usually missing anyways.
<br><br>
Now I know why regular expressions called regular expressions!<br><br>
I've been recording study /work sessions on OBS and speeding up x16 for fun with ffmpeg, a cool utility which can basically do any kind of file conversion or processing that you need<br><br>

In a typical case of local self-improvement minima, I tried to set up a python script to automate the ffmpeg command line calls today for a long time, messed around with subprocess and gave up.<br><br>

Did content work for synplifier (~20 new properties) and fixed CSS stuff. Did not have the energy to go into depth. I wish I could go to college already.<br><br>

Still haven't looked through mongodb + nextjs integration but plan to soon.

Goals for tomorrow:

Do the homework
<br><br>

<h3>February 6 <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3> <br><br><br><br>
Finished reading & taking notes to about p. 70 in Theory of Computation. The college application process should be officially over now -- last interview was this week. Applied to a handful of essay-first scholarships in the past two days. Fixed up site a little bit more.
<br><br>
Todos over weekend: <br><br> - Homework <br><br> - content work for synplifier <br><br> - finish ToC chapter 1 <br><br>

<h3>February 4 <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3> <br><br><br><br>
College interview today, another one tomorrow. No progress on anything except homework, but found a cool library for game theory in Julia.<br><br>


<h3>February 1 <span style="font-size: 14px; text-align: right; display: inline;">2021 CE</span></h3> <br><br><br><br>
Last time I said my Next.js blog needed more customization. Then I realized how stupid that sounded considering there was no content on it.<br><br>

From now on, my Updatelys will go here too: https://www.eric-xia.com/blog<br><br>

. The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
<br><br>
First update :O don't expect this much every time
<br><br>
I've been thinking about whether to do public updates. At first, I thought they might not be necessary; I've been taking zettlekasten notes for about 8 months now, and found Obsidian frictionless and super fun. And I write blog posts on my website to document major projects. Do I really need more writing?
<br><br>
But Obsidian is not a productivity tool. It's a tool for thinking/deep work/residual connections, and doesn't handle daily activities etc very well. Updately can hold me more accountable, and Samson's points about the advantages of learning in public make sense.
<br><br>
And more to the point, I want to increase my luck surface area, and that involves letting other people know what I'm working on in a super direct way. I'm not dropping music, no need to build up hype.

(Synplifier is an open source knowledge base making synthetic biology accessible for everyone.) - published new static site yesterday (https://synplifier.com) with AWS amplify (AWS abstractions very poor) - Plan is going from basic dictionary --> hyperlinks between terminology--> directed force graph --> protocols-as-pathways --> programmatic protocol visualization. But the information there has to be accurate first, of course - Working on full-stack with heroku today, to surprising success. Trying very hard to learn mongoDB and nodejs. No need for react here.
<br><br>
This weekend I also spun up a site for an art piece on the nature of work in the knowledge economy. It's a hackathon where I'm the only participant and the only challenge is to move 10 cubic yards of gravel across a football field.
<br><br>
Read like 2 pages from Sipser's Theory of Computation (for independent study)
<br><br>
went for run
<br><br>
minecraft, homework
<br><br>
scheduled driver's test
<br><br>
thoughts
I plan to share interesting links every update: Social networks are proof-of-work mechanisms (Instagram as proof-of-wealth, Strava as proof-of-exertion) Immortality is continuing the "great conversation" (RibbonFarm)
<br><br>
I need a real blog. I built one with Next.js but it needs some more customization. Blog posts in progress:
<br><br>
bayesian probability "quenching" with random number generator
<br><br>
science fiction
<br><br>
an analysis of every high schooler cancer cure claim ever made (good benchmark, and media analysis) Learning chinese, esperanto, spanish on anki/duolingo. Having trouble prioritizing.
To read:
<br><br>

Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas S. Kuhn (plan to publish notes).
Against Method, Feyerabend (advocate for scientific anarchism, i.e. rejection of authority)

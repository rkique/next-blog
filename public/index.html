                <p>(7.27.2022) I got COVID lol. I want to rewrite this website again because I'm not happy with a lot of the content. I realized that most of the separate .html files are older works and that I actually enjoyed the previous format a good amount, but I still want to have some visual non-gridified aesthetic. </p>
                <p>(7.19.2022) I have this idea that solves the multiple meanings problem with language. Given four equidistant points from a center point, they form a tetrahedron in 3D wordspace where each of the points is at the intersection of three planes of meaning. This also generalizes to higher dimensions, but with my current script producing four point/word/vectors I have
                    <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        moneyball luncheon proponent alumna
                        belated position circumvented existential
                        neutropenia crimping invisible marsupial
                        ...
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
                , where there are four meaning-planes, formed by taking three of the four words. Running this overnight and checking results then. 
                    </p>
                <p>(7.15.2022) Presented on tSNE language maps and then got some interviews done. <br><br>
                    Two delicious coincidences I've noticed recently. 
                    <br><br>The first one is the phrase "sign down". There are so many associated meanings (sign up, write down, sign in, write up) that you'd expect this phrase to suggest <i>something</i>, and yet it is a barren wasteland. Maybe "sign down (here, below)", but why not just "sign (here, below)"? 
                    <br><br> The second is that there are two major philosophies based on spoons that nicely complement one another. The first is "spoon theory", or only having a certain number of spoons in a drawer (representing mental energy), and the second is The Matrix's "there is no spoon", which is a post-scarcity declaration of anything being possible. Both make sense; taken together, it is actually a○n expression of the content/form distinction.

                 </p>
                 <p>(7.14.2022) Paired on clusters for tSNE maps of word2vec... got some clusters with k-means, then changed to DBSCAN which works surprisingly well, and the sklearn implementation makes it easy to assign words to clusters. The way DBSCAN works is that it looks for cluster cores, which at the current settings are two points (words) that are with a distance of 0.3 and with at least 1 neighbor (this is good for isolating extremely close vector pairs, like &quot;map&quot; and &quot;maps&quot;). Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/images/dbscan.png">bigger version that probably won&#39;t load</a></p>
            </p>
                <p>(7.14.2022) Finished <i>Red Mars</i> and short stories, made some progress on the rest. Today reentering the pairing pool, otherwise revising website.</p>
                <p>(7.11.2022) At home, working intermittently on various things. Reading a book on the topography of seattle, a collection of japanese short stories, man is the measure, the Dawn of Everything, red mars, and a little bit of graph theory.</p>
                <p>(7.6.2022) Spent the day walking around portland. I wanted to cross the border but it is not accessible to pedestrians. Did cross St. John's and Fremont bridges. Yesterday went to Powell's and read a bunch of picture books, and attended long NORC call from pioneer square. 
                <p>(7.3.2022) Minecraft is so fun </p>
                <p>(6.30.2022) Went to some chats with new Recursers, and readying a fun presentation for tomorrow on APL. Made this <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/time">kind of scaffold</a> (click to advance), experimenting with d3 as a tool for making slideshows. NORC is moving me from Amerispeak to GSS, which is awesome. </p>
                <p>(6.29.2022) Learned some APL, worked on socketio & eventlet, modernized JS on golf.</p> 
                <p>(6.28.2022)
                    (today, yesterday) updated word.golf to use XML http requests between prompts, creating a seamless no-reload experience. The backend code at this point looks terrifying, and there is a display bug where the first word isn't recorded, but it is a significant improvement for the UX :) I also shut down the MySQL database and any queries to it, in preparation for moving to another platform. I will have to do a lot more work to improve the code.
                    <br><br>(weekend, last week) Finished <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/imagenet2">Tapestry #2</a>, a 50x51 grid of ImageNet averages sorted by semantic similarity. In general these images look pretty muddled, but there's a painterly quality to it that I really like. Will continue to experiment with this. 
                    <br><br>Worked on a flask socket.io and eventlet server.
                    <br><br> Started learning Pixi.js, the library that tetr.io is built off of, and APL. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xAKttWgP4">Watch this video</a>. Symbols are so cool.
                    
                </p>
                <p>(6.24.2022) I can't shake the feeling that my site is actively hostile to thoughtful blog pieces now. Anyways, I should probably go work on golf or something. I've been averaging images from Imagenet with the squared root mean method and am about 1/3 of the way done, and basically procrastinating otherwise. Dataclasses are cool, __name__ == __main__ for runnable scripts, multiprocessing, os, numpy is really fast, and logging, timeit, dict and set comprehension. AHDNLNDLSVD </p>
                <p>(6.15.2022) Had a lot of fun this morning setting up an imagenet tapestry at <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/imagenet">https://www.eric-xia.com/imagenet</a> .The process for making these grids has become very streamlined. First you choose a lump of clay (a base set of word embeddings, 40-50k words) and then you carve away the words you don't need (imagenet's categories share around 2,500 words with word2vec, for the most part nouns: "ball", "sailboat", "pliers", "raccoon") you smooth it out with tSNE by going from 200 dimensions to 2, and then you shape it into a square grid (50x50)! Finally for this project I just took the first image from each category folder and displayed it, forming a mosaic. Originally I was just hosting the 2500ish images from github pages/netlify, but then I decided to use Amazon s3, which works better. I'm very satisfied with the result, and particularly like the yellow and blue diagonals where agricultural and nautical terms border one another. I might be able to do PIL preprocessing which can look for images only with white backgrounds or without them. 
                    
                Yesterday and today, I also worked on a cursor tracker in javascript similar to cursors.io or <a href="http://donottouch.org/">http://donottouch.org/</a>. Reading <i>Man is the Measure</i> by Abel.</p>
                <p> (6.8.2022) Read <i>Against Interpretation</i>, some notebooks from Susan Sontag, stories from <i>The Best American Sports Writing 2019</i>, Chuck Palahnuik's advice memoir, and took home <i>Uncanny Valley</i> and a book about the medical device industry. </p>
                <p>(6.7.2022) days 16 + 17. Started the morning not doing anything in particular except completing a training from NORC and some paperwork. Then I started looking at three.js examples and getting lectured by <a href="https://threejs.org/manual/#en/prerequisites">https://threejs.org/manual/#en/prerequisites</a> which is written by someone with very strong opinions about javascript. Then I spent the afternoon pairing on my old website, conceding a 1-&gt;2 approach instead of 0-&gt;1 (super helpful as a driver even without knowing anything about three! I aspire to have swiss army knife debugging skills as well someday!)  and watching code Game of Life! In Rust + WASM! While fire alarms were going of!  Anyways, I can&#39;t find motivation to learn Rust, cause although it looks elegant it doesn&#39;t seem like it does anything cool. Today is the 8th which is a wednesday, which means it&#39;s library day (the upper levels only open on wednesday)! Will head to the library and code and read after call.</p>

                <p>(6.6.2022) Day 15. This morning I had a coffee chat with who showed off some really cool demos and convinced me to go to the audio processing showcase. I&#39;m unzipping ImageNet still (15 hours remaining as of right now), but I was actually productive in the meanwhile. I hosted a github pages site with no snowballing problems with Vercel, hosted it on the site <a href="https://www.synplifier.com/">synplifier.com</a>, and stripped the react app from like two years ago down. Then I got a prototype kind of working, and during a pairing session, I had a series of major revelations about how react and npm work that will definitely at least double my javascript productivity from now on. Thank you so much for your patience and help! </p>
                <p>After the call, I went to the showcase which was really interesting, I really liked SunVox and SuperCollider, and realized that the noisecraft app is just scratching the surface when it comes to audio. I think it&#39;s actually built entirely on the Web Audio API, which is super cool....</p>
                <p>Anyways, after that I did about three hours of relearning synthetic biology terms and concepts, and glossed about 50 terms into my dictionary. Even though the DIY biology movement is very dormant right now, I feel really good about synplifier&#39;s use case. There are no friendly dictionaries for making things with biology. It is either theoretical easy stuff from AP Bio, or intensive graduate level research projects. Even without a lot of lab experience, I think I can provide much more intuitive explanations than others can.</p>
                <p>Plan for the rest of the day is to stop using my computer, maybe go outside or for a run. But I&#39;m super excited and optimistic today.</p>
            <p>
            
(6.3.2022) Day 14! Today I woke up late and did some urban hiking. I a book of financial advice from a little free library while walking around. It's still raining heavily, so I'm probably going to go to a bookstore and just spend some time browsing. I did some light es6 exploration, but also looked at svelte which is actually really cool. ImageNet did download so I will play around with it later tonight, otherwise just attended presentations.
</p>

                <p>(6.2.2022) Day 13. I always plan these posts as an exercise in efficiency, but inevitably go back and edit. Oh well. In the early morning, I poked around on noisecraft some more and made this <a href="https://noisecraft.app/620">squarish tune</a>. I then started experimenting with different AWS services, trying out the OCR service, chatbot service, and S3. I concluded that the best way to use my credits were probably a server for images, or maybe learning how to make an API. I renewed the synplifier.com domain name on Namecheap. I started downloading ImageNet (261 gb) for an archetypal navigator interface built on word vectors (I just took a look at it and realized it failed :(). Finally, I read a bunch of excerpts from NLP papers, some from the LUNAR lab at Brown, and it served to reinforce my impression of the field as one where essentially no progress has been made towards grounded understanding, except for where the gradual massive accumulation of internet data in Common Crawl+ has allowed for the construction of a few beautiful artifacts (word embeddings and models), like silt coalescing into a pearl. </p>
                <p>I then ended up having a coffee chat , where we discussed future plans and web development. This was all very interesting. I decided to learn javascript modules, so I could learn three.js, so I could visualize terrain and heightmaps. I then paired, where we spent an hour tackling a single tricky bug in his React knowledge guide, where a context was out of sync. I&#39;m very new to JS development, so it was super interesting (well, to watch... probably not to code), although I wish I could have contributed more to the debugging process. Then I went to the creative coding workshop, ported a recursive voronoi sketch that seems appropriate to name bloodcore(<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/rkique/sketches/Ev9aMTgLq">https://editor.p5js.org/rkique/sketches/Ev9aMTgLq</a>) , and started reading more about Hoff&#39;s algorithm and the trick employed for making it performant. Voronoi is such an interesting concept! I don&#39;t really understand it yet though. Then I left for the gym, and I just came back. I&#39;ll probably go back out again after eating dinner to sit somewhere in the international district and read, or some other form of productive procrastination.</p>
                
                <p>(6.1.2022) Day 12 of Recurse! Today was an incredibly fun day. I spent most of it learning how to use the Noisecraft node editor, attempting making electronic &quot;music&quot;. I am completely new to audio processing and found all of it very interesting, if a little overwhelming. I found myself reflecting on the process of visual programming, especially with an established community, and common strategies that can be employed. I found myself conceptualizing these strategies as 
<li>getting a minimum working example</li>
<li>forking existing projects and tweaking one thing</li>
<li>picking one piece to understand at a time</li>
<li>extending examples</li>
<li>combining examples</li>
<p>Enjoy my pieces from today:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;getting bludgeoned repeatedly on broken glass&quot; <a href="https://noisecraft.app/612">https://noisecraft.app/612</a> </li>
<li>&quot;liquified plastic horse&quot; <a href="https://noisecraft.app/614">https://noisecraft.app/614</a></li>
<li>&quot;ominous cowbell remix #1&quot; <a href="https://noisecraft.app/615">https://noisecraft.app/615</a></li>
</ul>
I also paired on word golf, adding streaks and discussing potential shareability and difficulty metrics that I could use. I&#39;m still wondering if there are more useful applications lying just beneath the surface... in the evening I was feeling cooped up so ran 11 miles to bellevue.</p>

                <p>(5.31.2022) Day 11 of Recurse! I think. I didn&#39;t code on Monday but I did quickly modify a DIY projection to play with here (<a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/projections.html">https://www.eric-xia.com/projections.html</a>) at some point. Today I was very productive but not for very long, pairing with Cody to make my first original interactive Observable, a <a href="https://observablehq.com/@759c6b835359aafe/us-household-income-by-region">visualization of household income by region</a> from the Census 2020 data. I think I understand banding, Observable, and Javascript better now, even with the hacky solution we came up with. I also played around with maps, read a cookbook (Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat), edited Wikipedia, and attended the Wacky Ideas Production Group, where I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm8JRlJ1q50">gem</a>.  I have so many ideas for what to work on next! A watershed map from USGS data, maybe. Or experimenting with Voronoi.</p>

                <p>
                    (5.26.2022) Day 9 of Recurse. I learned about Joins and Selections in d3 and spent way too long working on a p5 sketch as usual. I found a few ways to introduce visual complexity that work well together: perlin noise gradients, stepped lines, and overlaying groups of lines to produce a moire effect. Then I paired on an adversarial 2048 project in Rust, which was fascinating. I thought it was interesting how simple minimax is as an algorithm (well, in theory): if you can reduce a game to a single score, it doesn't matter how complicated the rules are, it's just another version of tug-of-war.
                </p>
                <p>(5.25.2022) Day 8! I didn&#39;t feel especially productive today, but looking back I think I learned a lot. Mainly some technical issues prevented me from connecting on Zoom, so could not pair. I read the first two sections of <i>Python One-Liners</i>. Learned about using map and lambda as an alternative to list comprehension, slicing, zip, combining np.nonzero and booleans to query arrays, and multi-dimension numpy arrays. Then I generated a second static grid from the older glove embedding, with more words but less curated. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/static_grid.html">link to the first one</a>. Then I started reading <i>The Map that changed the World</i>, which is about the foundation of modern geology by the self-educated surveyor <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_(geologist">William Smith</a>)); it&#39;s a <i>really</i> fascinating story. 
                    <br><br>
                    Specifically, it made me think about what constitutes a frontier in the public imagination. Frederick Jackson Turner wrote the &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot; in 1893. The west coast, Alaska, outer space, and the deep ocean have at various points in time been considered as the final frontier. What&#39;s so interesting to me is that even for William Smith, <i>in the 1700s</i>, geological history was not a pure frontier, in the sense of exploring new lands in other places; it was instead a reexamination, of the rock stratification around coal pits, of details dismissed by others to be uninteresting. By doing so, and realizing that the present is the key to the past, he was able to discover a vast amount of richness in earth and earth history. In the past, the church prevented these kinds of inquiry from taking place. The idea of fossils were viewed as heretical; everything was either already discovered, or divine will. And while it might feel like a lot has changed, I really think this idea of &quot;everything interesting has already been discovered, or requires massive amounts of funding, or will be found by large international consortiums of scientists&quot; is especially prevalent, at least among people in my generation. But I disagree, and stories like these encourage me.</p>

                    (5.24.2022) Day 7! Today was the first day I went into the field in addition to attending Recurse. After the pairing session I went to attempt interviews. I did not coordinate very well, but I was able to touch quite a few cases.

                    (5.23.2022) Day 6! Super productive and learning things. Made my first original graphs with d3 of github commit histories, and then wrangled the grid textfiles into a walkable prototype. Did not code after 2pm. No meetings. Will try to stick to the same routine tomorrow.

                    (5.22.2022) 20 miles to auburn and stumbled into a horse racecourse at Emerald Downs. The Interurban from Renton to Auburn are some of the most beautiful officepark aesthetics I've seen. Going to start reading an anthology of japanese short stories! Trying to stay off my computer during the weekend.

                    (5.20.2022)
                    Day 5! Today I worked mostly on word golf and ended up pairing on it. While I ended up getting a working prototype for four neighbor golf, because of the lack of an actual grid pretty much every word was circular. Just using the four closest neighbors definitely doesn't work. However, in the afternoon we rebounded and got a real legitimate grid (we had tSNE coordinates all of this time so I'm not sure why it didn't occur to me... lol). Excited to test this out soon. I also presented and watched some cool presentations, and learned about kernels and Rust.

                    (5.19.2022)
                    PS: Sort of done with <i>The Shenzhen Experiment</i>. So much of it seems utterly unreal to me. Being sent into the countryside as a teenager of the urban youth, building a floor of a skyscraper every three days, temples to sea gods, nail houses and peasant apartments, village industries, the collision of cooperative and competitive motives, idealism in utter poverty, boarding a ship to America and going to Ecuador instead... it still resonates powerfully, more my ancestral story than anything else.
                    <br><br>
                    Day 4! Today I mostly did d3 throughout the morning, attended the meet & greet call, and then ended up going on a reading binge of killedbyapixel's blog, a game dev and generative artist who produces extremely intricate artwork from 140 characters or less of javascript. I also attended the creative coding call, where I stumbled upon an interesting concept while making a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/rkique/sketches/0qKYaRWHw">simple symmetric draw tool</a> in p5. Because you have X and Y symmetries, each quadrant of the page actually makes up a *separate form of interaction* with the entire picture. In effect you can draw four different ways. For example, with the original exponential scale of mouseX and mouseY to the HSL color system,  drawing in the upper quadrants is negative space (black) or ambient blue and green. Drawing in the left bottom quadrant is white, grey, and yellow organic shapes; and the right bottom quadrant contains a rainbow of different hues. It's really fun to play with and so I spent hours just clicking and dragging. Then I remembered I had a pairing call and ended rescheduling it for tomorrow. Haha. Several calls tomorrow; will probably return to working on golf then.

                    (5.18.2022)
                    Day 3. Purposefully making this short to loosen future constraints. Today was not a productive day in terms of lines of code written; it was, on the other hand, supremely creatively inspiring. Tackled d3.js, read about Union Find, got linked to a bunch of geography and software blogs (Joe Morrison is an instant favorite):

<blockquote>If you work at the intersection of maps and software, at some point in your life you’ve probably heard yourself muttering some version of the following analogy to a stubbornly confused family member: "You know Google Maps? What I do is, like, build little pieces of Google Maps over and over for people who need them but can’t just use Google Maps because they’re not allowed to for some reason, or another."</blockquote>

I spent a good deal of my afternoon reading about deck.gl, satellite startups, OSM, Google Maps, climate change and change detection, Leaflet and Mapbox... all while half-listening to people talk about careers in the background (My theory is that this is what I've been missing! My most engaged times reading blogs last year were all during online classes where the pleasant background noise of teachers made me yearn for intellectual excitement!) As often happens with rabbit holes, I found myself inexorably drawn to the MIT Media Lab, this time through the Senseable city lab, finding ascii webcams, isochronic maps, space bubbles, and the theory of the pointiest path... yeah anyways so much to do. So little time. Must not write so much or so carefully from now on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    (5.17.2022)
                    Finally winding down for my second day, after around 10 hours. In the early morning, I chose to read my d3.js book, learning about loading with d3.csv() and d3.json(), and saw how you could create bins and scale data. I was alarmed that there wasn't any kind of note about the ease of misrepresentation: something like this is presented as one of the examples:
<br>
                    <pre>
d3.scaleLinear().domain([2000, 10000]).range([0, 500])
</pre>

<br>

When you create visualizations without including zero as a frame of reference, it's very easy to misrepresent the truth! This is data literacy 101! Of course, there are definitely some applications where you need to do otherwise, but I'm still really surprised. 
I did this instead of going to the check-in call; I prefer writing these checkins (checkouts?) out more than a conversational format. Plus, text is easy to share on my blog as well! 
<br><br>
After that, I paired on Game of Life! Using p5.js, we got kind of far; not only did we make a grid, we were even able to add six squares for an oscillator! Then we suffered what I assume is called technical debt and did not get to implementing any of the rules. I left to do l33tcode problems, but got distracted by the *amazing* text animations on https://musicforprogramming.net/ and only got the easy problem done. As kitschy or cute as text animations might sound (the shapes of these letters on my screen are so arbitrary! Why restrict yourself to them!), I find they portray the absurdity of language well,  what is almost a sense of fear that the shapes will stay as meaningless squiggles until the relief of discerning meaning. 
<br><br>
Then I had a call with the creator of the aforementioned word game, learned a lot, and got very motivated to work through the afternoon. I threw myself into an actually challenging problem related to making a standardized grid: given four neighboring points in space, how do you assign them directions? It's easy for a human but difficult (for me) to code in. There's trigonometry involved, and choosing between rotating clockwise or ccw.  I wonder if I'm missing a really simple approach actually. 
<br><br>
Here's a sample of that very messy code:
<pre>
#clockwise swing
def swing(indice):
    return abs(np.arctan(Xdiffs[indice]/Ydiffs[indice])) 
while len(quadrants) != len(set(quadrants)):
    for i in range(0, 4):
        if quadrants.count(quadrants[i]) > 1:
            #while more than one in same quadrants, move the closer one (indice wrt quadrants & diffs)
            indices = [index for index, element in enumerate(quadrants) if element == quadrants[i]]
            swings = [swing(indice) for indice in indices]
            minSwingIndex = indices[swings.index(min(swings))]
            quadrants[minSwingIndex]+=1
            #print(f"point with indice {minSwingIndex} moved from {quadrants[minSwingIndex]} to {quadrants[minSwingIndex]+1}")
            if(quadrants[minSwingIndex]) > 4:
                quadrants[minSwingIndex] = 1
            </pre>
<br><br>
I ended up successfully sorting four closest neighbors for each word into directions, but not isomorphic to a grid. While this was somewhat disappointing, visualizing a random walk of neighborhoods made me happy. I was able to build a utility tool to view undirected graphs very quickly, gutting my graph view and simplifying a lot of it (you can use it too! go to https://www.eric-xia.com/graphviz.html).  It's built on force-graph.js.

Finally, I uploaded my progress on research to my blog. 
All in all, I'm super happy with my work again. Tomorrow, I hope to be as productive as I was today and continue tackling hard problems!

                </p>
                <p>(5.16.2022) 
                    PS: Breakcore and golfing go so well together. Youtube playlists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoJ_VTA4PhY">ex</a> are amazing... feeling like there's a real positive impact to the sport. When word choice becomes unconscious activity, people no longer have to reach for words. Expressing yourself becomes natural. 
                    <br><br>
                    RECURSE DAY #1 <br><br>
I had a great first day! I adopted a parrot, walked around the park and took some selfies, and tried out the maze in the top right corner. I also met a bunch of super interesting people, and found out a certain popular semantic game I had been referred to many times was made by a Recurser! Finally I attended the Clojure Conclave, which was a meditative experience learning about things like generative testing and garbage collection.
<br><br>
All of the good energy also translated into a very productive session iterating on golf, where I started spring cleaning by removing large swathes of obselete functionality (including the user authentication page, links to view pages, and profile) and replaced it with a simple plotlyjs graph working with LocalStorage. I also generated and sifted through around two hundred additional prompts for temporary use (but plan to trade out daily 9 or 18 prompt courses in the future). For the first time in a while, I feel proud of golf again!
<br><br>
While this first day went really well, I was totally in my comfort zone. I need and want to engage in more hard problems and exploration. Tomorrow, I'll try to join in on the daily leetcode problems which I have no experience in, do my first pairing session, and actively learn from a hardcover copy of "D3.js in action" I checked out from the library. Thinking of diving into the GIS section and trying to build a simple geographical visualization for Amerispeak, the NORC project I'm a field interviewer for.
                </p>
                <p>(5.15.2022) Recurse begins tomorrow! Exciting! I was hoping to begin interviewing this weekend but I haven't got my badge yet. I really hope it gets here soon...</p>
                <p>(5.11.2022) Today was the second training call for NORC and I caught up on Recurse emails. I finally got some work done fixing word.golf and making it look presentable for now. I'm pretty tired so going home now, but excited for the coming weeks.</p>
                <p>(5.2.2022) God two jump precalculated word golf is so amazing and the prompts are so good </p>
                <p>(4.28.2022) Did some of the work. Need to script a short animation for initial display...<br><br>Read <i>The Complacent Class</i>, started a book about Shenzhen. I'm working on increasing engagement through 1. adding a certain number of weekly prompts and 2. different difficulties by distance. Also finally switched 100 glove out for a 200 neighbor word2vec model. I really like the direction this is going but there's a ton of front-end work before I can finalize it.</p>
                <p>(4.24.2022) Ran 31 miles to Tacoma yesterday, passing by the Georgetown neighborhood, the King County international and SeaTac airports, Kent, and Federal Way. I was thinking about the aesthetics of the metropolitan area south of Seattle vs north. They are similar at first glance, but the south side feels more rooted in history, with older and more interesting public art. For example, around the Rainer Beach brewery there are a bunch of poles by the railroad striped green and black, and tapering into a nasty looking spike. I was reminded of nuclear waste warnings, but they're apparently supposed to be artwork, representing trees. It's the same with the malls, the logos and advertisments are generally wackier and older looking than the Alderwood area. 
                    <br><br>I added a self-portrait around the About Me section, and also started writing about word golf under golfing.html. Started reading <i>Superstructures</i>, read <i>Shopping Mall</i>,  and <i>The Beggar</i> by Reinhard Sorge from an anthology of German Expressionist plays, which is very interesting. I've been working on some drawings but none that I want to put up at the moment. The current site structure is temporary, I will definitely be expanding downwards...</p>
                <p> (4.19.2022) <a href="symbolistics.html">Some word2vec associations of greek letters.</a> I want to publish projects somewhere! This site is definitely suffering from growing pains.</p>
                <p> (4.19.2022)  Realized I've become way too pessimistic about technology. </p>
                <p> (4.17.2022) Spent today drawing movie of stills and relearning blender. Tomorrow I'll be working on word golf; the infrastructure is in a good place, I just have to finally get around to designing six prompts for an inital challenge. They just have to be good; they don't have to be perfect. I find it much easier to start sketching with a ballpoint pen on notebook than on nice paper, but once I build up enough confidence I'll end up switching. </p>
                <p> (4.15.2022) Hit 7 miles at 6:30 pace yesterday to Othello of which I am quite proud. Ended up wandering around Renton and getting on three separate buses by accident.  </p>
                <p>
                    (4.13.2022) Read <i>1517</i> by Peter Marshall which argues the Reformation was invented, making my way through the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and <i>Ecotopia</i>. The Canterbury Tales, at least the first story about Arcita and Palamon, are absolutely enthralling. I walked five miles from Lake City to UDistrict while reading it. Something about the verse that leaves a mark in you... especially out as the sun sets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    (4.10.2022) I discovered the Central Seattle Public Library! It's an amazing place. Read <i>Norwegian Wood</i> by Murakami, <i>Black Dogs</i> by Ian McEwan, a book on wildfowl decoys, a Hegel primer, <i>100 Years of Solitude</i> (don't bother), a book about tarot cards, and <i>Aquinas on Virtue</i>, started reading <i>Magic Mountain</i> and <i>Analects</i>, almost done with <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> by Murakami. Oh also, <i>Ecotopia</i> which is a WILD sci-fi novel about a Pacific Northwest breakaway country set in 1999 (which, while published in 1970, covers a lot of the same ideas that are hot right now around urban design and walkable cities...). I'll write a nice long review when I finish: what has changed since the 1970s about American cities? And what has changed about our desires to improve them? Our ambitions?
                    <br><br>
                    Something I've re-noticed recently is just how important word choice is when making distinctions about abstract concepts. Religion for example: what does believing in a "higher power" mean? What do you associate with a word like "divine", "providence"? "consequentialist"? "form"? "formal"? "cause"? Language is different from math; this reminds me of the article I read a while back about how people experience things differently. For some, when they close their eyes they can literally see all sorts of squiggly shapes moving about, and others just see nothing, and as a result they are not talking about the same nothingness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3.30.2022) It's 1pm and there are still six hours of daylight left! This is amazing. Halfway through <i>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i> and <i>Economics for the Public Good</i>. Reviewed math this morning. I realized a couple days ago that I didn't have a .dockerignore, specifically forgetting to ignore .git, which meant that my container sizes had been 2 or 3 gigabytes too large all along! Now my deploy times are six times faster. And yesterday I removed 210 gb of old containers from docker desktop. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    (3.28.2022) Feeling good. Read <i>The Glass Castle</i> and <i>Starting with No</i>, working my way through <i>Economics for the Public Good</i>, <i>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i> and of course <i>Div Grad Curl</i>. Slowly but steadily improving my understanding of matrices and linear transformations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3.25.2022) I finished reading <i>The Soul of the New Machine</i> and beginning <i>Economics for the Public Good</i> in depth. I've recently been watching some fascinating videos, including Adult Swim's Infomercials, the beautiful surreal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_V-VJQT6pM">Interface</a>, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>, and the first seven episodes of <i>Servant of the People</i>, the TV series starring the current Ukrainian president. This show is deeper than most would expect. Right off the bat, the history-teacher-turned-president is confronted with accusations of populism and "putting a show on for the people". The whole show is about changing those deeply rooted beliefs.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm behind my goal of 200 books this year, but way ahead of where I'd be otherwise. Things I've been thinking about recently: young people, as a general rule, are much smarter than most intellectuals* think, and they have way more time to worry about themselves than you do. They also don't waste our lives doing things that don't matter to them. <br><br>

                    Along these lines, a good chunk of Twitter seems to be supportive of returning to the small web or reinventing the creator economy, in theory, but both exist already and are thriving in Neocities, the Yesterweb and Patreon; it's a cultural dissonance, and a reluctance to give up a talking point, that prevent this recognition.
                    <br><br>
                    This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes, which encapsulates many things I both worry about and love about technology. It's from an essay by Jill Lepore --  <i>The Last Time Democracy Almost Died</i>: "Don't ask whether you need an umbrella. Go outside and stop the rain". What I worry about now is the Effective Altruism poster I saw the other day. I worry about people, believing themselves to be optimizing agents, spending all their time thinking about agency, grantmaking, quantifying the possibilities inherent in people, how to extract that possibility. I worry about the whole exercise becoming turned out like any other activity on a college resume. Is it not beneficial in the long run though, people giving more to institutions that can do better? I don't believe the differences matter. It feels removed from reality, the same way productivity and lifestyle coaches are, and too ghost-like for me. But -- I will resolve not to worry about it, or think about it, because that's the advice I'm giving. I want to make synthesizer music now. I want to draw animations in a gritty, surreal style. I want to practice lockpicking, get really good at vector calc, and become fluent in Chinese. I want to work with isolates and skeletons and more contemporary, faster language models.
                    <br><br>    
                    Another quote from 1979 SF<i>The Missing Man</i>: "I mean, we don't know what happened in the past exactly. It's gone anyhow. It's not real anymore. So we can say anything happened we want to have happened. If one past is going to make trouble, we can change it, just by being dumb, and everything will straighten out. Like, for example, we just met, right now. Nothing else happened".
                    <br><br>
                    I don't have a real point for all this, but utlimately it comes down to saying: I feel like changing the future needs you to have a certain state of suspended belief in your mind, a genuine state of curiosity, that the environment and tech climate, feels unconducive towards. It doesn't feel creative enough in the ways that matter. I sound like a broken record. It's the same thing I was trying to get at in my other essays. Sigh. Love your work, people. At least I love my work!

                ADVENTURES IN IPHONE SE REPAIR
                <br> <br>
            1. broke screen while doing stair flights on the 15th <br> <br>
            2. had glitch effect until wednesday when unresponsive, could still use airpods and apple pay. <br> <br>

            3. Order screen online to fix.<br> <br>


            4. First fix a disaster. Try unscrewing plates and disconnect/reconnecting four times, still dead screen. Can still charge phone up until this point. Lose about half of screws, strip most of rest, damage black coating on back cover, rip the front sensor flex cable entirely. rip the home button cable halfway while trying to replace it. Up until 2 am before giving up. Convinced I broke the camera cable.<br> <br>

            5. Next day, surrounded by entrails of phone, review the original repair video many times. Learn more about iphone SE schematic by watching teardown videos. Read online forums. Browse /r/mobilerepair. Develop various techniques, such as pressing spudger against back of plate to provide leverage while unscrewing. Figure out what kind of screws (1.3 and 2.8mm Phillips Y000) and which screwdriver of the three provided actually works. Getting better understanding but still not any kind of progress.<br> <br>

            6. At home for weekend, discuss giving up and buying new phone. Although feeling like inputs and outputs ruined, refuse to give up on processor and battery. Determine provided screen was defective. Get replacement screen from amazon free of charge.<br> <br>

            7. Second fix today. Try to attach new screen to iphone. Replace only two main flex cables with few screws left. Phone dead, charging on old cable on wall socket. No response. Wish I had ammeter. Wonder again if internal damage. With no other options I plug into computer again to see if anything happens. To surprise, connect sound does. Nothing connected though. Look at phone.<br> <br>

            8. A light by SIM card tray is on! The apple logo shows up but immediately dies on move. Retracing steps, track down critical point. Determine there are four small coils on the top sensor assembly bracket, which when touched immediately shutdown. Problem is I have no more suitable screws for the top sensor. Remember seeing reddit post making fun of mall kiosk repairs with shipping tape. Repair using strip of shipping tape. But cut out hole so it cannot melt.<br> <br>

            9. Apple logo always loads and phone is reassembled! Screen loads to say "phone unavailable". Power off and reset, managing to get an erase phone option, unfortunately asking to press home button to start reset. Turn off and on again until message is replaced with language selection menu. Begin normal setup. Realize that I didn't actually rip the camera cable and main camera still works fine! Can purchase new home button and front camera.<br> <br>

            Total cost: $30!

            <p>(3.18.2022) <a href="food.html">How to be a vegetarian</a>. Okay. Just spent the day working on word golf. Plan for rest of day is to go to gym, consume perishable items at home, and then replace my phone screen. I've been reading snippets of <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>, <i>30-second physics</i>, <i>div grad curl</i>, and some math online. In general I'm happy with my understanding. I will keep looking and thinking about applications in real life. </p>
            <p>(3.14.2022) It's been a rainy week. I'm reading <i>The Soul of the New Machine</i>, finished rereading <i>The Lighthouse</i>. I've started writing more things.  </p>
            <p>(3.7.2022) Just finished writing a long email and about to go to bed. 30 miles yesterday from Bremerton to Kingston. Thinking about word.golf again. I think the promise of it is like this: 
            If there is a single sport that can claim being a sport of the mind, it would be something very similar to word golf. The basic concept is, unambiguously, trains of thought. There are two shortcomings that are very difficult to overcome. Why should the grid be oriented towards the target? Is it possible to standardize orderings, and if not, how do we provide a foundation for strategy? These two problems might provide solutions to one another. A cooccurence wordspace, trained on contemporary texts, with curated words and no filtering. Each word will provide exactly the same neighbors each time, in the same order. It's more natural. It could be harder at first. But then it would get easier.

                (3.2.2022) Finished <i>Zero to One</i> this morning. Read <i>Sports and Contemporary Society</i>, left reviews for both on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107099617-eric-xia">Goodreads</a>. Started <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> but it's kind of boring.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4584800712">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I read this in a thrift store, skipping sections near the end about sports, race, and gender as the text I read from is 1979.<br /><br />There's an abundance of fascinating analysis in this collection as well as some historiographical points of interest. At this time there were two major trends when it came to sociology: the functionalist and conflict theory schools of thought. The book compares the role of sports in society from these two perspectives. From a functionalist point of view, sports serves as a microcosm of society and aids in its proper functioning. It is primarily an inspirational force for good which leads to the continued functioning of society, providing benefits social, moral, spiritual, and of course physical. From a conflict school of thought, sports is viewed as an opiate. The existence of sports is a progressive, fordist installation meant to subdue the spirit of the working class. The existence of sports transforms the pure joy of unstructured play into "prisons of measured time" (I really, really like that quote). In general though I agree with the functionalist point of view here.<br /><br />There are two essays in this collection which stand out not for their subject matter but for their stunning lack of rigor. One is an analysis-comparison of drive drain (the hobbesian notion that violent sports serves as an outlet for a baseline of violent impulse) and cultural pattern theories (the more modern belief that violence is transmitted purely culturally and that using sports as a hedge against war will always backfire). The author endorses the cultural pattern theory -- on the basis of "ten randomly selected violent and nonviolent civilizations throughout history" and a smattering of meaningless data. He then proceeds to lecture the audience on p-value and correlation (lol). Garbage in garbage out. Another is at the end of the book, by a feminist author who loves to write what is ostensibly academic jargon in capital letters and also use the word "gynergy" a lot. And call sports "MenSport/OldSport/UrSport".<br /><br />But on the whole this is a remarkable collection of essays, much better quality than I expected and very interesting. One essay is about the capacity of football to cause harm, and notes that NINETEEN players died in the 1905 professional football season. With the well-intended proliferation of hardshell helmets this issue has only gotten more controversial, as the durability of these helmets made them, ironically, an essential *weapon* for players, allowing them to ram others headfirst. <br /><br />Other essays here focus on participation in sports among youth. I can definitely see, in the form of a reaction to a reaction, where this whole idea of "America gives out too many participation trophies" comes from. Because it's clear that America in the 1970s was INTENSELY focused on winning within sports, and correspondingly about success in business. All of those quotes "when the going gets tough, the tough get going" which seem incredibly outdated today were very commonplace. There's one statistic about Watergate: 60% of of interviewed junior managers said they would cover up for their superiors if in the same position. So all of the participation trophies, the trend away from relentless winning to a stance that prioritized intrinsic joy, were created by a collective realization of parents in the 1970s that the culture had become too competitive. And so maybe we're trending another way again today...<br /><br /><br /><br />

                (3.1.2022) New graphview with force-graph looks amazing. Walked 26 miles through Renton and Kent today. Finished <i>Hyperion</i> (far-future sci-fi, Dan Simmons), <i>Into the Wild</i> (the full story of Chris McCandles), <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</i> (PKD), <i>Anything You Want</i> (sive.rs, business), and <i>Shoe Dog</i> (nike). Going to start reading <i>Zero to One</i> and then hopefully <i>Economics for the Common Good</i>.

                (2.25.2022) Okay. I'm sculpting the Google News word2vec model. Initial vocab size is three million. First thing is to index against wordfrequency for a zipf score of 1.5 or more (average occurrence of one in 31 million), which immediately reduces size down to 245k. Removing forbidden characters (like # which encodes for any number) reduces to 157k. These are both relatively low-risk operations; forbidden characters does not exclude the single hyphen '-' or the apostrophe, and zipf only excludes words like "srebotnik" or "baronetage". The next trickier step is eliminating first and last name words, which can lead to namehell. Using a standard list of english names will lead to excluding words which have a common usage, e.g. "baker". So instead, we will perform a double-negative operation on the list of names, which uses a free dictionary API to eliminate words with a standard definition. That's where I am right now -- the API limits continuous requests but I can chunk input/output in batches of a thousand or so. Update later.

                (2.24.2022) Wow. Nothing is as frustrating and liberating as the feeling that if there were two copies of yourself you could get everything you wanted done. Studying physics, chinese, reading <i>hyperion</i>, <i>zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance</i>, <i>introduction to genetics</i>, <i>godel escher bach</i>, creating a TSNE model of GloVe, restricting Word2Vec to a similar set, designing a screenprintable golf poster, working out regularly, drawing ... 
                <br><br>
                Springtime is here.
            </p>
            <p>(2.21.2022) Updated this site with tweaks to the color palette and spacing. <a href="/HSKreading.html">Here's a mini project</a> with beautifulsoup that links all of the HSK Reading articles in a single place, allowing you to see which links you've visited. Now you can learn chinese with me! </p>
            <p>(2.20.2022) I am attending math camp. Practicing ... single-variable integration! Hurray. 
                <br> <br>
                Finished <i>American Psycho</i>, Halfway through <i>Project Hail Mary</i>, started but probably won't finish <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> by Neil Postman. <i>Project Hail Mary</i> has a lot of wishful thinking on the part of the author: <i>"The field of speculative extraterrestrial biology is small—only five hundred or so people in the world. And everyone I talk to—from Oxford professors to Tokyo University researchers—seems to agree that you (middle school science teacher) could have led it if you hadn’t suddenly left!"</i> but it's also pretty exciting, with the same kind of DIY experiments as <i>The Martian</i>. <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> is interesting from a historiographical perspective -- what are the constant worries of the intellectual class? What are the new ones? Spoiler: there aren't many new ones.
            </p>
            <p>(2.16.2022) Updates... Reviewing <i>div grad curl</i> and I'm happy with my understanding now, at least for div. There really is an intuition about surface integrals you can build, approximating solids as squares instead of area as slices, and of flux, as alignment at many points. I'm just over halfway done with <i>American Psycho</i>; yesterday I read <i>Redshirts</i> by John Scalzi, which I probably wouldn't recommend. I'm going to write a full review for <i>Pyscho</i> but my initial impressions are really good. It combines the emotionless droll of a didactic perfectionist with sequences of unhinged madness. It is in heavy criticism of what is not quite consumerism but still a failure to engage, present at the highest levels of society. Music, skincare, designer clothing, furniture -- it is all exquisitely described and yet the mentalities of the characters (who fade in and out in a blur) remain primitive.
            <br><br>
            I also wrote something up on why <a href="salmon.html">removing the Snake River dams won't save the orcas</a>.
            </p>
            <p>(2.14.2022) XMLHttpRequests are amazing and I can't believe no one told me about them. Today I am doing math all day. I am feeling very inspired.  </p>
            <p>(2.9.2022) Inkjet transparency sheet came out looking stellar, now I'm waiting for emulsifier to dry. I also got my laminator! Unfortunately the mesh resolution (110) is almost definitely not good enough but the main graphic and larger text should be fine. Will go to Blick to get more supplies before dinner though. Other than that, making a minor UI fix which will take two hours and doing math. Why does it have to recompile the whole container? Sad. 
            </p>
            <p> (2.7.2022) Did a marathon across both 520 and I-90 bridges yesterday. Did not run at all today. Instead did stat analysis on golfing prompts, got quotes from print shops, and bought screen printing supplies. Found hardcover Shakespear -- <i>Richard the Third, Anthony and Cleopatra, The Comedy of Errors, Tempest</i> -- in a little free library. Finished <i> Pictures of Fidelman</i> which I found underneath a sculpture in Capitol Hill. Plan for tomorrow: run math morning, design monochrome posters night. Also -- I'm getting better at cooking! </p>
            <p> (2.5.2022) Lots more work today on golf. Redesigned google authentication to use GSI and also styled cytoscape to work with color scheming. Also worked on the mobile layout. Posters are seeming more like a viable option. Super proud of how far I've come. Will spend the rest of the night drawing.

            <p>(2.4.2022) 10 mile run this morning down to Madison Beach. 
                
                Figured out how to output JSON from the database model and formatted it. Implemented a graph viewer with cytoscape.js fed with JSON. The spacing algorithm is "cose-bilkent". It's basic, so in the future we want to have closest path and start and end words highlighted, better spacing, animated interactive etc. but this version works great for diagnostics. Went through 255 base prompts and identified the ones with the highest entity counts, basically words and links. Around 85 or a third of them have 100 entities or more; these are the top completed and probably most interesting prompts, and we can restrict play to them in the future. Out of those 85 (graphed) I identified 12 outliers with 198 entities or more. Analysis of these outlier prompts show that they are heuristically much more interesting than the average prompt: pilot>pineapple, discovery>quilt, mammal>argument, taxi>alphabet, quartz>limit, neon>mechanic. I'm thinking I can do some statistical analysis (what difficulty? what distance? what diversity? what range?) now that we have a good empirical basis (~3000 completed runs) on which to grade prompts, and a convincing metric for a good prompt (Do people complete it?). One interesting note is that for almost all potato>flag runs the player will go to "country" which is not directly connected to flag, but eventually find their way over. I really like the shape of taxi>alphabet and monitor>pupil. catcher>bowl and pipe>license exhibit a lot of loopy behavior. Finally I was surprised by that none of these prompts exhibit bottleneck behavior where the player always goes to a middle word before the finish.

            <p> (2.3.2022) The past few days have been eventful. I'm trying to do math and work on golf, which doesn't leave a lot of time for other priorities like reading. I still want to have time to explore and draw different things though. I might take also protracted break from thinking, because I haven't really enjoyed thinking lately, due to the mess of discourse around tech that doesn't really interest me. One thing I have noticed however is that writing becomes more difficult the longer you put it off for. So maybe it's back to the same habits as before: just with updates here about my daily activities.  </p>
                <p>(1.29.2022) Review of V. Which I Finally Finished After A Week of Reading</p>

            My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4498020452">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
            V. is more historical and surrealist than what I originally imagined. The closest works I've read before to V. would be, in terms of subject matter, Hugo by Brian Selznick, and in narrative complexity, Aliens and Anorexia by Chris Kraus. In terms of alienation, the concept of electronic automata was already fully developed at this time, and it's a big focus in the later chapters. Happily V. is also not a tired existential "nothing", a concept which is developed with minor characters but which doesn't affect the main plot.<br /><br />While a work like Infinite Jest has a central location of Boston which is then zoomed in and out off in a dizzying fashion, V. is more an exploration of two characters across time, and their immediate circles in various moments of historical crisis: Suez Canal crisis, Fiume, Malta, Cape Town, and going from the early 1960s back to the 1890s. One is Stencil Jr, who is chasing after a briefly mentioned figure from his father's notebooks known as V. The other is a Benny Profane, who I assume is vaguely autobiographical given that he is part of the Royal Navy and Pynchon served in the US Navy.<br /><br />However, Infinite Jest and V. are very similar in terms of the complexity of its minor characters, of which there are many -- this kind of irreducible complexity is a mark of modernist writing in general. There's really interesting section early on about a depressed Zionist sailor named Da Cohno who purchases a machine gun in a salad bar and spends his days assembling and disassembling it.<br /><br />In particular I was very surprised by the complexity of the Arab characters in chapter three, although I suspect they don't really stand up to much scrutiny historically; he admitted to writing that chapter off of Baedecker's travel guide to Egypt. It's much better than DFW's use of "experialist" though.<br /><br />Here's what Pynchon has to say about tourism and multiculturalism.<br />> This is a  curious country, populated only by a breed called "tourists." Its landscape  is one of inanimate monuments and buildings; near-inanimate barmen,  taxi-drivers, bellhops, guides: there to do any bidding, to various degrees  of efficiency, on receipt of the recommended baksheesh, pourboire, mancia,  tip. More than this it is two-dimensional, as is the Street, as are the  pages and maps of those little red handbooks.abundant  flush of water and a supply of proper toilette paper"), the tourist may  wander anywhere in this coordinate system without fear. War never becomes  more serious than a scuffle with a pickpocket, one of "the huge army . . .  who are quick to recognize the stranger and skilful in taking advantage of  his ignorance"; depression and prosperity are reflected only in the rate of  exchange; politics are of course never discussed with the native population.  Tourism thus is supranational, like the Catholic Church, and perhaps the  most absolute communion we know on earth: for be its members American,  German, Italian, whatever, the Tour Eiffel, Pyramids, and Campanile all  evoke identical responses from them; their Bible is clearly written and does  not admit of private interpretation; they share the same landscapes, suffer  the same inconveniences; live by the same pellucid time-scale. They are the  Street's Own.<br /><br />Here's what Pynchon says about psuedointellectual culture:<br />> referring to himself as a Catatonic Expressionist and his work as "the  ultimate in non-communication." Melvin played the guitar and sang liberal  folk songs. The pattern would have been familiar - bohemian, creative,  arty - except that it was even further removed from reality, Romanticism in its furthest decadence, being only an exhausted impersonation of poverty,  rebellion and artistic "soul." For it was the unhappy fact that most of them  worked for a living and obtained the substance of their conversation from  the pages of Time magazine and like publications.<br /><br />If anything, I feel like both DFW and Pynchon are really good at constructing places, more than buildings but the whole zeitgeist, flow of people, expression, melancholy... It is still impossible for a machine to write like this. The sewers of new york are fascinating and grim, the shipyards are unhinged, and and this from in chapter nine: <br /><br />>Just as its own loose sand was licked away by the cold tongue of a current  from the Antarctic south, that coast began to devour time the moment you  arrived. It offered life nothing: its soil was arid; salt-bearing winds,  chilled by the great Benguela, swept in off the sea to blight anything that  tried to grow. There was constant battle between the fog, which wanted to  freeze your marrow, and the sun: which, once having burned off the fog,  sought you. Over Swakopmund the sun often seemed to fill the entire sky, so  diffracted was it by the sea fog. A luminous gray tending to yellow, that  hurt the eyes. You learned soon enough to wear tinted glasses for the sky:  If you stayed long enough you came to feel it was almost an affront for humans to be living there at all. The sky was too large, the coastal  settlements under it too mean. The harbor at Swakopmund was slowly,  continuously filling with sand, men were felled mysteriously by the  afternoon's sun, horses went mad and were lost in the tenacious ooze down  along the beaches. It was a brute coast, and survival for white and black  less a matter of choice than anywhere else in the Territory.<br /><br />Also, here's another part from the african colony section I loved (referencing wittgenstein, honestly made me think of a Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy). <br /><br />> One night he was awakened by a disheveled Weissmann, who could scarcely  stand still for excitement. "Look, look," he cried, waving a sheet of paper  under Mondaugen's s slowly blinking eyes. Mondaugen read:<br />DIGEWOELDTIMSTEALALENSWTASNDEURFUALRLIKST<br />"So," he yawned.<br />"It's your code. I've broken it. See: I remove every third letter and  obtain: GODMEANTNUURK. This rearranged spells Kurt Mondaugen."<br />"Well, then," Mondaugen snarled. "And who the hell told you you could read  my mail."<br />"The remainder of the message," Weissmann continued, "now reads:  DIEWELTISTALLESWASDERFALLIST."<br />"The world is all that the case is," Mondaugen said. "I've heard that somewhere before." A smile began to spread. "Weissmann, for shame. Resign  your commission, you're in the wrong line of work. You'd make a fine  engineer: you've been finagling."<br />"I swear," Weissmann protested, hurt.<br /><br />The problems with V. are the same as the problems with any other large famous modernist work, which are the length and pointlessness of description and the lack of empathy for the pop culture of the 1960s. Many passages about Italy and Europe felt so texturally indistinguishable that it kind of blended together -- but it still evokes a very powerful wanderlust. Another Pynchon theme, aside from creating fictional journal entries, is creating fictional songs, some very well written:<br /><br />    A sad tango on the last night of the old world<br />   A girl who peeped from between the palms<br />   At the Phoenicia Hotel<br />   Maria, alma de mi corazon,<br />   Before the crucible<br />   And the slag heap,<br />   Before the sudden craters<br />   And the cancerous blooming of displaced earth.<br />   Before the carrion birds came sweeping from the sky;<br />   Before that cicada,<br />   These locusts,<br />   This empty street.<br /><br />I probably won't be reading any more books like this in the near future cause I have to hit 200 but I really enjoyed this one.

            <p>
                (1.26.2022) I'm still not done with <i>V.</i> but it's really good. I've been experimenting with some different postprocessing techniques, also implemented a dark mode for word golf and working on a daily challenge and explanation screen. 15 to Kirkland, didn't quite make it to Bellevue before it got dark. 
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.22.2022) Ran 9 to Juanita. Started <i>V.</i> by Thomas Pynchon. 
                <br>
                Finished <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> and <i>Never Let Me Go</i>. Did 13 miles to Silver Firs yesterday, probably try long distance again today. I've been writing some code and drawing otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.20.2022) Finished <i>The Glass Menangerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on A Hot Tin Roof, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, I Hate You: Don't Leave Me, To Live </i>by Yu Hua <i>, The Paper Menangerie, </i>a stupid machiavellian pyschology book,<i> Ovid's Metamorphoses, The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up,</i>and  Vonnegut's <i>The Sirens of Titan. </i> Look at my Goodreads if you want to read my reviews. Halfway through <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.14.2022) Finished <i>The Paper Menagerie</i>. Will probably try <i>Blood Meridian</i> next. This morning I started working on a sundial maker.
            </p>
            <div class="f6">(1.13.2022) Two major things from today: <li>Reading <i> Genetics for Dummies</i> and <i> Evolution: A view from the 21st century</i>. The ongoing debate over Darwinism/the Modern Synthesis/ directed/adaptive mutations is fascinating, I can't believe it wasn't mentioned at all in school. The author makes a pretty convincing case that natural selection, which fundamentally runs on innovation and not variation, is not in fact driven by random mutations or copy errors but by a myriad of intentional processes within cells which move and modify sequences. The genome is both read and write, not simply read-only. Even random mutations are constrained by the cells themselves; higher adaptation in times of stress and lower adaptation when not. And to tell the truth, natural genetic engineering actually seems like the only logical conclusion wrt plasmid transformations in bacteria which is what iGEM is all about... </li><li>Over halfway done with the <i>The Paper Menagerie</i>. In general I'm not quite so impressed with the catalogue / Marco Polo in Space stories, of which Ken Liu has several, but I really liked <i>State Change</i> (TS Eliot references), The Perfect Match, <i>The Paper Menagerie</i> (which isn't even science fiction), and <i>Mono No Aware</i> which I just realized I've read already. Liu has a wider dynamic range than traditional Chinese SF authors -- there's a western, a war story, a mystery -- but a more constrained view of life, more superfluous adjectives, more traditional plotlines.</li> I also finally got Docker working again so you can find timed word.golf is up and running.</div>
            <p> (1.12.2022) Finished Broken Stars. The very first story, Goodnight Melancholy, is about Alan Turing and a fictional chatbot he builds, and whether a machine can really be like a human. Moonlight by Cixin Liu is alright.  Broken Stars is a horror story, disturbing in its own way. Salinger and the Koreans is funny and worth reading. Under a Dangling Sky is also really good, a strong archetypal fairy tale + Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is interesting as well. The Snow of Jinyang is predictable but very dense (about a stranded time-traveler who attempts to change history). What Has Passed Shall In Kinder Light Appear is really good, a kind of natural reverse chronology of China. My favorite two stories are definitely <i>What Has Passed</i> and <i>Goodnight, Melancholy.</i>  </p>
            <p>
                (1.11.2022) Reading translated chinese sci-fi anthology <i>Broken Stars</i> which again shocks me with the the density and gravity of the ideas conveyed. I particularly liked the first story, did not appreciate the namesake story as much. Wisdom is acceptance of irrationality.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.10.2022) The problem with existential literature is that it is effectively a play on words and our perception of reality, establishing a sense of profound understanding between you and the author so that you may characterize it as important but certainly not making you any happier. Dostoyevsky understands this but still wants to prove that he too is clever which is why I infinitely prefer White Nights to Letters from the Underground.

                Git is fixed but AWS is broken.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.9.2022)
                word.golf is now fixed! But I forgot about the w2v file so git is broken. Tomorrow I am going to get up early to work on it again. Maybe 5 miles today on reverse I-5.
                I can't leave golf in its current state... fixing it now.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.8.2022) Took advantage of good weather to make it to Everett today, about 14 miles. Tomorrow I'll do a recovery run. Thinking about which Coursera course to do next. Also I want to read my genetics book.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.7.2022) Ok. Word.golf day. I wasted time trying to implement timing by tacking on a runs completed variable and rendering a display with p5.js. I need to design a prettier progress bar, speed up the backend, ... actually there are actually words that I should remove too, like "rise" and "drop". Did eleven miles to Silver Firs today, probably longest run since August. I should set a time for two-day trip to Tacoma. Bad news: will rain next two weeks. Good news: it won't snow!

                (1.6.2022) Dostoyevsky is good. Taking a computer break today.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.5.2022) Whew! Subconsciously I've kind of starved myself artistically by trying to make word golf a very stripped down sport, and now I've gone a bit crazy on my personal site. Colors, buttons, flickers etc -- I'll pare back on it as necessary but this is a good place to work from. 
            </p>

                (1.4.2022) Finished my online course. Still working through the design of this website. I'll probably be experimenting with some big changes before settling down on anything. I like the general look right now but some of the links are missing. 

            </p>
            <p>
                (1.3.2022) This is starting to look good but it needs more time. But also, I can't stand the look of my old site anymore! I'm going to have to finish this later. I'm (really) almost done with the Coursera ML course! Just have to do collaborative filtering and then I'm done. Matlab was impossible to begin with but I've learned to check dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
                (1.2.2022) Designing my new site is hard. It's one of my New Year resolutions though. Also, I started learning Rust today.
            </p>
            <p>
                (12.10.2021) I had a really inspiring conversation yesterday that made me think hard about my future. I still have so much to learn, about life, my place in it, what I can do.

                  Custom prompts are here, implemented with an additional run_uuid column in mySQL. Enter

                 word.golf/p/[start]>[target]  to try it out. This will give me additional flexibility when implementing curated timed sets, and eventually allow users to create their own timed sets.
            </p>
            <p> (12.5.2021) Been working through the Coursera machine learning course. There are a ton of programming assignments I didn't do in sequence with the videos. Still, over halfway done with them!
                
                Lots of word golf work its going well.
    
                I realy want to rewrite my blog to a more immediately interesting form. It can have a microupdate section, and then a projects section to highlight cool things.
    
                Read Sinopticon, an anthology of chinese science fiction from this year. It's really, touching and inspiring. There's a perceptiveness unique to chinese writing that american english can't come close to. The closest thing is borges and that's also translated.  
    
                Also read Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut and Envisioning Information by Edward Tufte (really good). Also started reading Cryptonomicon (I'm getting sick of Neal Stephenson's social theories of hobbit and dwarve culture), Infinite Jest , "the first great internet novel" (it's really good), Red Mars (first of the trilogy), and reviewing Div Grad Curl. 
    
                Made a bunch of drawings since Inktober.

                <br>
                <p>I&#39;m a student living in Seattle before enrolling at Brown this fall. I'm currently working as a field interviewer for NORC and attending the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center's</a> Summer 2022 batch. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-xia-seattle/">(Looking for another Eric Xia who goes to UW?)</a>. </p>
                <p><br>
                I believe everything matters: among other things, I&#39;m interested in philosophy, literature, computer science, biology, and art. Recently I've been fascinated by word vectors; a lot of that work is living here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I&#39;m proud to have received grants from Emergent Ventures and the 1517 Fund. I am designing a competitive sport called word golf which employs vectors for modeling languages. I believe strongly in intrinsic motivation and want to create new sources of meaning.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This site is made with a CSS framework called tachyons, which is great for building sprawling websites like these, and served with Next.js on Netlify. Word golf is built with flask, gensim and other NLTK libraries, and MySQL. If you&#39;re curious about anything just email me! I respond quickly.</p>

        <p>Custom prompts are here, implemented with an additional run_uuid column in mySQL. Enter <pre>word.golf/p/[start]>[target] </pre> to try it out. This will give me additional flexibility when implementing curated timed sets, and eventually allow users to create their own timed sets. </p>

        <p>I'm also starting to brush on some very light gradients for word golf. In my opinion it really does make it look much more composed, even if it sacrifices the internationale look.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Been working through the Coursera machine learning course. There are a ton of programming assignments I didn't do in sequence with the videos. Still, over halfway done with them!</li>
            <li>Lots of word golf work its going well.</li>
            <li>I realy want to rewrite my blog to a more immediately interesting form. It can have a microupdate section, and then a projects section to highlight cool things.</li>
            <hr>
            <li>Read <i>Sinopticon</i>, an anthology of chinese science fiction from this year. It's really, touching and inspiring. There's a perceptiveness unique to chinese writing that american english can't come close to. The closest thing is borges and that's also translated.  </li>
            <li>Also read <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> by Kurt Vonnegut and <i>Envisioning Information</i> by Edward Tufte (really good). Also started reading <i>Cryptonomicon</i> (I'm getting sick of Neal Stephenson's social theories of hobbit and dwarve culture), <i>Infinite Jest</i> , "the first great internet novel" (it's really good), <i>Red Mars</i> (first of the trilogy), and reviewing <i>Div Grad Curl</i>. </li>
            <li>Made a bunch of drawings since Inktober. I'll put interesting ones below. </li>

            <li><b>How do we make single use things beautiful,e.g. waxed cups or plastic bags.</b> Mostly I was thinking about manufacturing a colorful thermosensitive material which would set very slowly. After an hour of being held the sides of the cup would form muted gradients as with a ceramic glaze. To avoid graffiti, the effects of the heat would have to propagate symmetrically around the cup, as in <i>drawsilk</i>. Thermosensitive materials exist, like what they use in mood rings, but I don't know if it works on thin plastic.</li>

            </li>

            <li><b>Rental car software is pretty terrible. </b> When we went to rent a car, the machine would print out an error slip <i>every</i> time you pressed the "I don't have a reservation" button. It's literally the same kiosk for every rental company too. </li>
            <li><b>Flying cars exist but there isn't a market for them.</b> I visited the Smithsonian Air and Space museum and there's a whole section dedicated to small, light planes meant to be affordable for the masses: Monnett Moni, rotorcycle, aeronca C-2, Nagler Rolz 54, Cosmos Phase II, Double Eagle II, Gittens  2000 Ikenga 530Z .. I imagine the $10,000 pilot license is one barrier. On the other hand, paragliding still sound awesome.

        <h3>Is irony a defense against a depressing reality? </h3>
        <p>I don&#39;t believe that irony is our last defense against a depressing reality because truly depressed people don&#39;t make ironic jokes. When you&#39;re truly depressed, you panic or become withdrawn. Instead, irony is a defense against a boring reality. </p>
<p>Traditionally, ironic humor is seen as a defensive measure against the <i>depressing</i> nature of reality e.g. when someone is infuriated with bureaucratic measures. Yet I see it used more in tweets (well, Instagram screenshots of them) against knowingly exaggerated depictions of reality: the idea that the world is falling apart, or burning down, capitalism doom etc. It&#39;s a proferrance, a concession that someone will play fast and loose with reality for the sake of relatability.</p>
<p>With irony you sacrifice long term ideals (pursuit of truth) for short term ideals (engaging chit-chat). It&#39;s still an expression of energy, of thriverism, which although fake, mirrors the reaction of a true believer. It&#39;s alive, but dead. It&#39;s zombified belief.</p>
<p>The practical alternative to belief isn&#39;t not-belief, which is depressing; it&#39;s ironic belief, which happens to look the exact same without context.</p>

        <blockquote>Oblivion is the ideal aesthetic. It’s like the tragic self-awareness of Lana Del Rey’s “Carmen”: “She says, ‘You don’t wanna be like me, working for fun, gettin’ high for free.’” And, “Darlin’, darlin’, doesn’t have a problem. Lying to herself ‘cause her liquor’s top shelf.” Daisy Buchanan in a nutshell, no? Glorifying mental illness is supposed to be bad, or so I hear from Tumblr, but it keeps me alive. I have to believe that there’s something glamorous about being depressed because otherwise it’s that much more depressing.</blockquote>

        <p>Finished <i> Humanity</i> (1999). I liked the book, it was clear and more thoughtful in handling cricitism than something like <i>Enlightenment Now</i>. It covers the first world war, the 1919 blockade of Germany, area bombing during WWII, Hiroshima, Stalin, Serbia, Pol Pot, Mao, the Cold War, and finally the Nazi movement. </p>
        <p>The book highlights the need for a moral imagination and the freedom to be skeptical. Faced with moral
            dilemmas, our human responses, which are naturally sympathetic, become overwhelmed, weakened, narrowed, or
            eliminated. Killing gradually or at a distance can absolve individuals of responsibility.

            Playing fun game where I try to remember things I read this morning.
        <ul>
            <li>American Auto (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) have seen falling market share from 70% in the 1970s to 30%
                today. GM has beat Ford for the last few years, who has seen several CEOs come and go with little
                success. Both Ford (which has stake in Rivian, which recently IPO'd (love their polestar 2)) and GM are
                competing for the electric vehicle market. Biden has set a goal of half electric vehicles nationwide by
                2030; Ford predicts they can get 40%.</li>

            <li>Tunisia's president now rules by emergency decree. Under their democratic system, there's been 10
                different governments in the last 10 years; Economist remarks that it's still better than the one-man
                autocracy of the last 23 years.</li>
            <li>The latest estimate for carbon emissions from food is a shockingly high 34%, much of it coming from
                beef. Cows are more intelligent than dogs and consumer decisions matter. No corporate apologia, eat less
                meat. </li>
            <li>I agree with the scepticism around cultured meat (insurmountable barriers mean the price is unlikely to
                drop below $17/pound), but the Economist seems to think its viable. Even plant-based giants Beyond and
                Impossible price their products above beef, and they aren't that good (yet). Aside from those
                possibilities, I think Gen Z would willingly eat insects or mushrooms. They need to be widely available,
                not sure how supermarket politics work.
            </li>
            <li>Canada and China finally traded Huawei person for two canadians. </li>
            <li>Brazil wants a nuclear submarine still</li>
            <li>London stock market sucks</li>
            <li>FIVE parties in Germany (where elections are proportional) got more than 10% of the vote (the SPU &
                CDU/CSU will likely form a coalition). The blocs are as often young/old as they are
                liberal/conservative.</li>

            <li>My blog has come a long way, but it still doesn't feel like a place where I can publish finished work.
                Considering: Obsidian Publish, another Netlify site, a HTML template for blog posts. This form
                limitation is synonymous with a process limitation: I'm writing this in VSCode directly into an
                index.html file. Maybe Jinja could help here? </li>
            <li>It takes about twenty minutes to deploy Word Golf. That's too long. </li>
            <li>With analytics in place I've started showing golf to more people. Not giving anything away yet but the
                numbers are promising. </li>
            <li>The next version: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>uses much better prompt pairs </li>
                <li>deals with critical mobile issues: unicode checkmarks and background-clip don't render in Safari

            or its reflection in the real world that appeals to me? Alternatively, are those two things inextricable? If
            we were able to manufacture wooden skyscrapers with the same ferocity & scale as steel, would anything be
            missing? If potters, crotcheters, artisanal jewelers had visions of absolute scale would they get the same
            respect? What about earring makers in a society which only recognizes earrings as a legitimate art form?
            When we evaluate acts of will, do we take them on their own grounds as we claim, or simply because they
            represent power?</p>
        <p> Alternatively, what if only powerful things can be beautiful?</p>

        <p>Certain systems appear easy to work with because you're operating within a simplified, human-intelligible
            version of them already. For example, formal structure within chemical diagrams, or Wikipedia lead people to
            overextend their resemblance to the real world. </p>
        <p>This is a common idea. The Rationalist refrain "The Map is Not the Territory", tightening interpretations &
            implicit meaning in <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>, Ribbonfarm and James C. Scott's <i>Seeing like a State </i>:
            at the most basic level, the size and importance of this gap is the main point of contention between the
            sciences & humanities.</p>
        <p>Simplicity makes simplicity. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>everyone hates computational poetry. What is special about a Haiku? Less words.</li>
            <li>In language the things that you can scale by are largely irrelevant</li>
            <li>attempts at scaling across semantic categories will fail</li>
            <li>Oh, you were able to include fruits AND types of medieval architecture? That&#39;s completely
                irrelevant! There is no diversity here, only meaninglessness. Only careful restriction leads to meaning
                when we&#39;re cutting holes out of language. Attempts at random scattering across many categories will
                also fail, as current wordfreq sets do.</li>
            <li>INFORMATION is a SHAPED CHARGE. MEANING is DIRECTION</li>
            <li>choice of axis is as difficult of a problem as writing poetry. Can the result be better?</li>

        <p>What is a bag-of-words list compared to a topic indexed one? Unfortunately, this is really a search problem,

        <p>What word vectors provide is <i>general semantic representation</i> as far as Wikipedia and news datasets
            can be considered as general. The question is, what can we do with these Ideal forms?</p>

        <p>Here's an honest change of heart after reading that article and seeing this quote about Stripe's impact: </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Stripe is basically a B2B SaaS company with extremely reliable capture of upside when users succeed.” I
            believe that substantially underappreciates the actual business. Large portions of Stripe’s business add
            another loop on top of the B2B SaaS loop, where Stripe is effectively indexing on its ability to grow the
            count and success of customers who are themselves structurally equivalent to B2B SaaS companies...
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've long considered meta companies to be uninspiring. Yet this has mostly been because I don't trust them,
            and see them as low traction and impact (SaaS to SaaS to SaaS). Yet when Stripe's goal is to increase the
            GDP of the internet, and they're clearly succeeding at that; what's bad about meta for meta? From a creative
            perspective, it might not be as directly fulfilling. But specialization drives civilization. From this
            perspective, Stripe is a transformational technology, a kind of miraculous fertilizer for the internet
            ecosystem. It is <a href="/index.html#1">aesthetic altruism</a>, same as any other
            engineering feat.</p>
        <p>Not sold that growth is good, but I won't dismiss meta as ineffectual.</p>
        <h3> ghosts and shells</h3>
        <p>There are two ways you can fail to reach your vision: it can remain a ghost or a shell. </p>
        <p>A ghost is a failure to create something at all, either because you&#39;re afraid it isn&#39;t perfect or
            because things don&#39;t end up coming together. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, a shell is a failure to create what you want, where bad never comes close to good.</p>
        <p>If you&#39;re afraid of building shells, you risk leaving visions as ghosts. But if you&#39;re too afraid of
            ghosts, you end up with a collection of sad shells. </p>
        <p>Right now, as a kid, I tend to be more afraid of ghosts, because you learn more in the process of making
            shells. Later in life, though, I think I&#39;ll be weary of shells and happier in the presence of ghosts.
            Even if I can&#39;t make them real, knowing of their existence will be enough.</p>

        <h3>my cultural influences</h3>
        <p>What makes a life interesting? I've been radicalized on this issue for a long time. It is the reason why this
            blog exists at all. I've consistently struggled to put those thoughts in writing; in lieu of an essay, I've
            made a list of things that say something meaningful about the time and place I live. I'll try to keep this
            updated. </p>

        <p>I'll put the prompts into JSON format, with neighbors and definitions prepopulated. Then I'll give each
            prompt a unique ID out of 350. Then, I'll store successful runs in MySQL for each ID. This will provide a
            real backbone for competition. </p>

        <p>Doing back-of-the-envelope science™ aka throw CSV files into GSheets to trim down initial load times. We can
            see that the way we calculate neighbors can be improved to more consistently get below 0.6 seconds. Ideally,
            we should calculate the results beforehand, and make a txt file which provides the results just by looking
            them up. </p>
        <p>I've been procrastinating doing this because that would require 1. small custom sets & 2. a curatorial touch,
            which I have been lacking recently. </p>
        <p>Luckily, retrieving definitions is the more consistently costly half and can also be fixed by prepopulating a
            text file. I'll work on that next. </p>

        <p>The Unmoored</p>
        <blockquote>But even her dreams are turned against her. After she shows a passing aptitude for story-telling,
            her parents sign her up for creative writing classes and poetry jams. The beloved characters in her flights
            of fancy are clamped into straightjackets and paraded onto stage to be judged by panels of condescending
            curmudgeons.

            When she finally escapes her shackles, there is no temperance to her wildness, no second-guessing, no
            backward glances. She drops out of pre-med, then out of college, then out of polite society altogether. The
            world is joy and light and one-way airfares.</blockquote>

        <p> Here are three stand out insights that go beyond "Sunk Cost Fallacy": </p>
        <blockquote> You rose to meet the challenge. Your peer group rose to meet you.
            Yesterday, you were bad at everything, and that really sucked.
            Today you’re good at one thing, and you’re hanging on for dear life. Success gave you something to lose.
        </blockquote>
        <p> Also see anecdotes and antidotes, and their experiences with how important short term memory is for learning
            math. It's a good reminder: be fearless. Keep asking questions. There are only a few really hard things.
        </p>
        <blockquote>People often worry that they cannot do mathematics because they are not clever enough. This is a
            very serious worry, because as far as we know everyone is born with a certain amount of clever and nobody
            really knows how to get more.

            I think people should instead worry they cannot do mathematics because their memories are too poor. And I
            think this is very good news, because memory can be trained, and deficiencies in memory can be optimized
            around.</blockquote>

        <p>There is a very important idea to me, roughly "no subsumption of ultimate justification". Precociousness is
            valuable in its own right and should not need heady social responsibility to justify it. Play should never
            be justified by work, a cardboard rocket never by future promise as an engineer or product manager. </p>

        <p>Scrolling through Astral Codex Ten has brought back a longing for quora. There's so much going on at any
            given moment that keeping track of it all is impossible. My plan for the rest of the day is to write blog
            posts, read blog posts, learn docker, stress about not knowing biology, do some math, clean my room,
            transfer my laptop stickers, figure out how to use my label printer. Kids my age are really kind of

        <p> I want to find an easy side project for the rest of the summer to counterbalance my creative work. I'm

            hole, book review etc.. I could spend more time on learning chinese characters. But in terms of what's
            useful + pertinent I should just be reviewing math. The downside of that is that it isn't easy. Maybe I'll
            watch math youtube videos.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>OH MY GOD!!</p>
        <p><i>There's a reason why using rigged prompt sets is so good, and its because when you curve towards a nearby
                target it's an additional filter pass for strange neighbors of the original word. </i>This means for
            rigged targets, the curve is able to solidify the original aesthetic while simultaneously pointing towards
            the target. </p>
        <h3>August 15th <span class="tt">2021 CE</span></h3>
        <p>There's a lot of things to do... but there aren't really any things to do.</p>
        <p>I've finished my placement, and I've decided tentatively what courses I want to take first semester: CS,
            computational molecular bio, linalg, and my first year seminar.</p>
        <p> As always there's a bunch of things that I want to understand: macroeconomics, chinese characters,
            multivariable calc. I think I'm starting to get the hang of photoshop. And of course there's a ton of
            experiments to do for word golf. <i>But I shouldn't approach these things like a sprint in these last few
                days -- I'll have a lot more time to learn & to build. I'll just try to keep up some steady progress,
                some momentum going into the school year.</i></p>
        <p> Just off the top of my head, what needs to be done for word golf: build in a historical tree structure (not
            sure if this is even the right thing), build a front page with themed sets, prototype themed sets. There are
            several offshoot projects that I have not even gotten the chance to think through fully: little alchemy, a
            poetic word generator based on neighbor word topography, and the potential for (linguistic, psychological,
            communication) research tools based on full 200/400 word lists. </p>
        <p> I'm experimenting with displaying 90 curved words down to 7 curved words, which is much more parseable but
            less beautiful. I guess when you move from word to word the neighbors still form a shifting window into
            wordspace, which is marginally cool but not crazy enough. Balancing beauty and speed -- how do we approach
            that problem? </p>
        <p> Thought: what if worse neighbors disappear as time goes on? That seems effective for maintaining skill gap
            and speed -- but the issue is still that a single word's location is aesthetically tied to the current word
            and not the target, so the homing effect is disorienting. The idea of movement is itself somewhat unnatural.
        </p>
        <p> A previously considered possibility: discard the target word, simply have the user navigate through a curve
            set up against random wordspace. </p>
        <p> What about a kind of pruning, where the user clicks to discard words which are not neighbors? That could be
            interesting, where the aesthetic effect increases with the players work. But that would make for a confusing
            mess to begin with... but aybe not more than the current confusion at the unrelatenedness of the start word.
            Yet its also not natural to search for unrelated words. </p>
        <p> Or inspired by alchemy, where a word is presented and you need to find the two words which will produce it
            when combined semantically. That might come down to just locating neighbor words, however. </p>
        <p> Feeling right now that the current vision for a golf sport is well defined, but golf isn't good enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Then again, maybe it is. There are too many failed paths -- this can be solved by rigged prompt sets
                e.g. curated prompts sets drawn exclusively from 2/3 step linked neighbors, and tightening the curve
                when the user strays too far away. The words are not close enough or strangely linked: this can be
                solved with better data (in particular, excluding newspapers) and lowering the pool amount. Smaller pool
                = harder but more coherent. So I think small pool + rigged custom prompts could be the right way to
                go.</i> I have not made any attempt at rigged prompts yet, I need to test that out because it could be
            a game changer. It is always good to keep in mind: diversity kills intent like a firehose to a flowerbed.
        </p>

        <p>I have a lot of experiments to do :) </p>

        <h3>August 13th <span class="tt">2021 CE</span></h3>
        <p>Labeling this as a sport is inaccurate. Capturing quick mental flights does not need to be in the context of
            sports, and the golf label is not easily understood. Unnecessary complexity. Going back to game means too
            much like Monument Valley, e.g. meditative. What do you call a new way to interact with language? An
            interface? media/medium? Something intricate and curious. Maybe I do need to invent a word here.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Here's the vision:
        <ul>
            <li>word golf is beautiful when it deals with highly specific words that capture a range of well-directed
                and evocative concepts. See below: hideaways, sluice, shade, seance, doorknob, votive. <i>This problem
                    of finding expressive words is exactly analogous to writing poetry. You cannot say something is
                    "mystical" or "awe-inspiring" because adjectives are easily dulled by their use in a million of
                    boring contexts. You have to dig deeper into the public psyche. </i> </li>
            <li>Attention is our scarcest resource and everyone hates computational poetry. "Freeplay mode" should be
                killed immediately. Instead, move towards releasing small sets of curated words. Incidentally, this
                solves the weak motivation for competition problem. </li>
            <li>The main page has to be absolutely perfect. Tile display like <a
                    href="https://tachyons.io/components/collections/posters/index.html">this</a> and great posters.
                Some word sets are free, others require an account.</li>

        <h3> if you can read this text, you are too close</h3>
        <p> This concept (seen on the back of a truck on the highway) has a few different versions. You could imagine a
            memetic in a language, perhaps on a dead alien planet: "if you can decipher this text you are doomed".
            Probably already a SF staple but we'll see.</p>
        <h3>primacy in images </h3>
        <p>
        <p>Consider the range of images created in an attempt to express a primal message, from childhood scribbles to
            photorealistic renders of elaborate scenes. Neither the scribbles nor render approximates real life in their
            construction (the scribbles don't try to). Both are products which cannot be reused, which cannot penetrate
            any more than simply by viewing them. There is no practice in visual art which can achieve immortality: a
            monk spending their entire life illuminating a manuscript does no worse than a professional artist or
            animator today. If you can see the primal vision within a scribble as well as you can of a Pixar movie there
            is no difference in their effectiveness. </p>
        <p>The nature of the scribble is more earnestly primal, attempting to convey a truth which has not been exposed
            to the brittling effect of reality. Reality makes images more brittle because while it provides a medium for
            communication, those images never approach reality itself, due to their expressed purpose as images. Forced
            to choose between an idea and the impossible task of communicating it, an image will trade its primacy for a
            communicable approximation.</p>
        <p>But actually this is not really true. <i>Although it cannot convey its original message to an onlooker a
                scribble can still convey an abstract idea of itself. It can convey a communicable message of a primal
                message. In the failure of another person&#39;s earnest attempt to draw something exactly the way they
                see it, it is possible to glimpse your own attempt. </i></p>
        <p>In contrast, a photorealistic render can convey a communicable message primally, in the sense that if you did
            somehow think the message on screen it would appear to be that exact same primal message. Inevitably, we
            don&#39;t. But <i> it is an approximation of primacy in a different sense than the scribble.</i></p>
        <p>These two extremes provide a justification for all kinds of visual expression, from the painstakingly
            inefficient to extreme facility. As long as something is made with an authentic vision, it can convey a
            message that means something to someone.</p>

                <blockquote>So, to summarize:

                    We see almost no relationship between labor OR material costs, and construction costs for
                    residential construction, outside of whether you’re in a western country or not.

                    The US does particularly well at building homes, apartments, and other projects that have low
                    administrative overhead or government involvement.

                    The US does particularly poorly at projects with a high degree of administrative burden, government
                    oversight, or where the government is a major stakeholder. European countries do far better by
                    comparison.

                    There’s little evidence that US homes are built to worse standards than in comparable countries.

                    For residential construction, there’s little evidence that other countries have substantially more
                    efficient construction methods that the US should adopt.

                    In the US, low construction costs translate to low property prices, making the US an outlier in

                <blockquote>If you build a robot that only handles the main workflow and can't handle any of the
                    exceptions, you're not automating anything; you're building a convenience tool. Basically, you're
                    removing some of the labor part of the job, but still keeping the decision making part of the job
                    for humans.
                    This is both economically unviable and largely unpopular. You're not reducing labor costs by much,
                    because you still need humans around. And workers lose control over their job, and have to "work
                    around" the robot's limitations. Instead of being freed up to do more work, they become babysitters
                    of machines that they have to oversee so it doesn't mess up everything.
                    This is why partial robotic systems don't really exist; either it's a nifty tool that speeds up a
                    small repeatable process of your work, or it's building the entire house.</blockquote>

        <h3>August 4th <span class="tt">2021 CE</span></h3>
        <p> A note for later: finding difficult words should be easy with an automated run of the hacked version. Just
            prefire for potential targets and see if it reaches it within 100 runs -- if not, then there is a rift in
            the local geography. For example, I just tried to get to "ring" but even using the closest neighbor every
            time traps you between "belts" and "rings". </p>
        <hr>
        <p> I know what to do next.</p>

        <p>Right now the biggest challenge is that you can wander off course and get completely lost. I can do one of
            two things: first, implement a safety net ("It looks like you've wandered too far off course, would you like
            to be taken back?"). However, what is really getting me excited is the second idea. I've been playing with a
            hacked version, which sorts wordspace by how close they are to the target word. This makes the first link
            always the best one. Now, instead of simply presenting the closest neighbors of a word, we can present a
            randomized selection from a curve: one from the top 3 closest <i>to the target</i>, five from the top 10
            closest <i>to the target</i>, 30 from the top 50, etc. This will make the game much faster, and hopefully
            highlight the skill differentiator in a better way than before. Now you don't really need to worry about
            getting closer to the target with each stroke -- but you want to get there as fast as possible. And some of
            the options will be much, much better than others. For example homonyms are freakishly good. They're like
            portals. They let you to wormhole across wordspace, go from a part like fish to a part like musical
            instruments. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>I just realized that I haven't actually installed Elastic Beanstalk on my new computer, which, from past
            experience, means it will take at least a day to build again. Also apparently my version is getting
            deprecated? Sigh.</p>
        <hr>
        <p> Here's another good example of optimal play. Starting from fish and going to clarinet is a difficult run,
            rated 8.6 on the similarity-log scale. But by making use of a homonym along the way, it can be done in just
            6.2 seconds and 3 jumps. </p>
        <pre>
        Go from fish to clarinet 8.6
        trout 0.0s
        bass 1.3s
        clarinet 6.2s
        Way to go! You reached clarinet in 6.2s and 3 jumps.

        <h3>Online dictionaries </h3>
        <p> Update: I feel stupid, just search github english words and you can find a bunch. I already did this a while
            back, not sure why I didn't implement spellchecking then. I think <a
                href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt">this</a> is the best one with 479k
            words and 5k stars. </p>
        <p> It's surprisingly hard to find online dictionaries for determining whether or not something is a valid
            english word. <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/">SCOWL</a> seems like the best thing I could find -- it's
            upstream of pyenchant which they don't seem to mention anywhere except a single github thread.</p>

            The site has been reverted to its original state, prioritizing the blog above the visualization (which you
            can find on the right side!). However, the workflow is still much improved with editing in VSCODE and
            pushing changes to a git repo. The tradeoff is that I lose AWStats, the benefit is that I don't actually
            have to pay for hostgator anymore.

        <h3>June 12th <span class="tt">2021 CE</span> </h3>
        <p> So much done today! </p>
        <p>Spent the morning getting timestamps working, using a helper utility to scrape git last modified dates for
            each markdown file. That way when the files are built on the server the date is the correct one. </p>
        <p>Along with some vital UI upgrades I got a skeleton 3D canvas set up within Next.js with three-react/fiber <a
                href="https://elegant-minsky-b916c9.netlify.app">https://elegant-minsky-b916c9.netlify.app</a></p>
        <p>I also finally got around to setting up an SSH key for github, so now I can push changes live really quick.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Spent the evening on <a href="word.golf">word.golf</a></p>
        <p>now there are routes for every english word! Try word.golf/staircase or word.golf/mango </p>
        <p>After some deliberation I removed the timer from the main interface. It's distracting and prevents people
            from exploring. Might reintroduce it for specific modes though.</p>
        <p>I also implemented copy to clipboard, connected git to github, and fit more words. </p>
        <h3>June 10th <span class="tt">2021 CE</span> </h3>
        <p>I graduated high school today, which should warrant at least a medium amount of self reflection. </p>
        <p>First off -- I&#39;m experiencing an increasing amount of friction with the tools I use. This includes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most annoyingly the &quot;f&quot; and backspace key caps on my keyboard have flaked off. This has
                resulted in an unnecessary rewiring of those key locations in my mind so that I can hit them right on
                the nub.</li>
            <li>
                <p>My Obsidian vault, which has gradually devolved from a well kept garden of school notes to a zoo of
                    different sized thoughts. I will need to go back and categorize my writing and reflections more
                    carefully.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I wanted to find a way to immediately publish notes from my vault. Should I pay for Obsidian
                        Publish? ($8/month, $96/ year which is a large expense but not impossible to get). </li>
                    <li>The thing is, I don&#39;t even use a lot of markdown features. I just want links, lists, and
                        headings to persist. to be honest I&#39;ve gradually stopped using links due to site display
                        prio. RIP zettlekasten</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>My computer is running out of space and frequently overheats or fails to charge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>My site has gone from a list of projects to an unstable scatter of clickable things and a huge one-page
                blog. Editing this blog.html file is becoming more and more unsustainable. <ul>
                    <li>How to solve this?</li>
                    <li>reimagine the main page to automate pushing objects to a scrollable display without three.js.
                        This scrollable display can be done with css/ tachyons, although to be honest it&#39;s not that
                        interesting. </li>
                    <li>How do I present primarily visual projects aside primarily textual projects in an engaging way?
                    </li>
                    <li>The current approach of just taking screenshots of bits of text to paste onto the three.js
                        canvas is terrible. I need to find a way to automate this. I&#39;m reluctant to use / adapt an
                        existing static site generator: maybe I can build one? This is a fun side programming project
                        that would result in a unique sort of website.<ul>
                            <li>How to present my interests/ organize knowledge efffectively<ul>
                                    <li>What ARE my interests anyways</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>when in doubt, simplify. there are two essential projects for thought-sanity:
                <pre><code>  - Clean Up Day: spend a few hours cleaning up <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> obsidian vault.

        <p>Next steps: Completion logic (total time, ↻start again which gets a new target_word). Display words and time

        <p><i>Heroes</i> by Franco Bifo Berardi attempts to connect the Internet, nationalist movements, and mass
            murderers like James Holmes vis a vis <i>Joker</i>. It has promising lines of thought but is ultimately
            far too academic. The words are muddled ("financial capitalism" and "fractalized time") and the book lacks a
            real unifying theme.
            There is something very important here though to be explored between social spectacle & violent rage.

        <hr>
        <p>Four runthroughs of the new mechanism. The first word is always taken from a list of 1,000 most common
            english words. The next word, illustrating the "correct" path, is then a random choice from the 10 nearest
            neighbors of the last one.</p>
        <p>Problems: most noticeably the existence of fragments in the GLOVE vocabulary. To be removed. Also cycling
            back, and the existence of very similar words e.g. Judge and Judges. </p>
        <p> Otherwise it's quite exciting. The idea is that running through something of this length should take maybe
            30 seconds max, as the user makes quick instinctive decisions as to which word is more related. </p>
        <img data-src="/images/word_ex.PNG" style="width: 100%">
        <p>Current idea: choose between closest neighbor and random. Choosing correctly takes you on a walk through
            word-space.</p>

        <p>Do one easy task and one hard task at the same time. This way, you balance out any momentary frustration with
            a known reward simply for existing. </p>

            teeth</p>
        <p>you can do this everyday by writing in the margins while reading, or recording your screen as you work.

        <h3>May 14th <span class="tt">2021 CE</span></h3>
        <p>After 23 successive deployments and 12 hours the app finally got onto heroku (briefly, before crashing out of
            memory): <a href="http://word-golf.herokuapp.com/golf">http://word-golf.herokuapp.com/golf</a>. I need 1gb
            RAM which is $50/mo. I am going to look into switching to AWS elastic beanstalk. Either way I am glad i will
            never have to go through this again.</p>
        <p>mistakes I made while deploying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>using backslashes \\ for specifying file path (assume windows specific). forward / worked</li>
            <li>not putting the entry point (wsgi.py) outside of the rest of the application folder. This ends up being
                necessary because the line ". import routes" in create_app needs to know there exists a parent folder?
            </li>
            <li>Didn't even have a wsgi.py file for a long time. unfortunately that's the file that actually creates the
                app.</li>
            <li>specifying the wrong versions of dependencies, and not using a virtual environment from the beginning.
            </li>
            <li>the Procfile, which specifies the entry point to the app for Heroku, has a really weird format: "web:
                gunicorn wsgi:app". The variables are on the left side :| </li>
            <li>I kept on setting __init__.py as the entry point, not wsgi.py because it does fine locally with "flask
                run"</li>
            <li>happily I did not download 6 gb Visual Studio C++ when gensim asked me to. Instead I abandoned my
                attempt at making a virtual environment </li>
            <li>dotenv, which lets you configure flask with a .env file, wouldn't install so I removed it </li>
            <li>forgot to specify modules in requirements.txt</li>
            <li>didn't have requirements.txt in the root folder</li>
        </ul>
        Overall though this was a hard-won victory. I am ready to continue
        <hr>
        I was so naive.
        <hr>
        <p>the MVP is deploying to heroku right now! I have saved the login auth work for when I have more than 0 hours
            of sleep.</p>
        <p> wasted some time making fireworks in p5 which don't even look that good. Got a lot of other stuff done

                Taking 3,001 responses to a research study that asked its participants how many uses of a paperclip they
                could think of (Guilford&#39;s Alternative Uses Test), I searched a stock icon library and got about 600
                unique representations (fishhook, dart, slinky, clothespin...). Collectively, these images are a
                testament to both human ingenuity and the number of roles a paperclip can take on.</p>

            <p>The second is a 37-minute long video of me shoveling a pile of gravel in my backyard. It asks the
                question: What is the nature of work? </p>
            <p>In the knowledge economy of today, work is about ideas. You brainstorm projects, create proof of
                concepts, propose solutions to problems. These ideas are the products of today&#39;s knowledge economy,
                the proof-of-work for knowledge workers. </p>
            <p>Yet our traditional image of work is informed by manual labor. Moving rocks, digging ditches, carting
                gravel: our mental models for work are based in physical action and incremental progress. It is
                measurable and quantifiable. By highlighting this video as a creative work, the video frames manual
                labor as knowledge work. By juxtaposing these two radically different kinds of work, I aim to reduce to

            <p>The third and final project is an existential one. It centers around a single mental image: two Youtube
                videos playing at the same time, &quot;Lofi hip hop beats to study/relax to&quot; and &quot;15 sorting
                algorithms in 6 minutes.&quot; The resulting sound is chaotic and unsettling.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The lofi music -- interchangeable, forgettable, soothing -- is a coping mechanism, a dream. It is a
                distraction from the Sisyphean nature of the sorting algorithm.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The sorting algorithm embodies work, chaos brought to order over and over, representing a life&#39; spent
                in a fast-moving field, perhaps software programming. Databases, applications, interfaces: they create a
                temporary semblance of order, but to what end? They will be soon replaced, their replacements replaced.
                All that is left for the worker is the time itself, living in an uneasy truce between the music and the
                work.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Adding to this theme is a wilderness survival guide, a wall calendar, The Blind Watchmaker by Richard
                Dawkins, a potted plant, assorted change, a freshly sliced orange, a wallet, car keys, a statistics
                textbook -- and the Dewey Decimal System, a system for categorizing the entirety of human knowledge into
                a series of answers to ten questions we don&#39;t actually have the answers to, namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do we organize information?</li>
                <li>Who am I?</li>
                <li>How did I get here?</li>
                <li>Who are the people around me?</li>
                <li>How can I communicate with others?</li>
                <li>How can I explain the world around me?</li>
                <li>How can I control the world around me?</li>
                <li>How can I enjoy my free time?</li>
                <li>What are the stories of our lives?</li>
                <li>What was the world like in the past?</li>

        <h3>Notes on Consumer Society, Jean Baudrillard (1970)</h3>
        <p>More reading notes. From <i>Selected Writings</i>.</p>
        <h4 id="the-bad-part">the bad part</h4>
        <p>Baudrillard describes consumerism and the modern grocery store (in a section called &quot;profusion and
            displays&quot;. This part is not good. </p>
        <p>He is attempting to criticize the &quot;endless imagery of feast&quot; and the meaningless choice, but in my
            opinion what he describes are either trivial marketing tricks (&quot;We can observe that objects are never
            offerred for consumption in an absolute disarray. In certain cases they can mimic disorder to better seduce,
            but they are always arranged to trace out directive paths.&quot;) or genuinely positive things -- its
            particularly funny when he says that
        <blockquote>our markets, our shopping avenues and malls mimic a new-found nature of prodigious fecundity. Those
            are our Valleys fo Canaan where flows, instad of milk and honey, streams of neon on ketchup and plastic.
        </blockquote> Baudrillard conveniently omits the fact that supermarkets carry milk and honey. What does he even
        mean by a stream of neon on ketchup and plastic?</p>
        <p>Baudrillard dismisses progressive principles. He says that there is a &quot;fable&quot; of the man who once
            lived in Scarcity but now lives in the Society of Affluence. However, in economics, &quot;Among all the
            unknowns of economic science, needs are the most persistently obscure&quot;. This hints that consumerism
            does not fulfill human needs. This is what skeptics see as the consistent failing of [[Enlightenment Now,
            Steven Pinker]] type books: the [[hedonic treadmill]].</p>
        <h4 id="the-good-part">the good part</h4>
        <p>&quot;The beauty of the surroundings is a precondition for a happy life&quot;</p>
        <p>Baudrillard says something which I feel is pretty insightful which is that the all-in-one unity of the
            shopping mall and the futuristic city (think Northgate mall, or Northline Village, or any ice cream +
            theater + condos + &quot;market&quot; development) really prioritizes perpetual shopping above all else.
            This is akin to the casino which opens up a buffet to get gamblers to stay for longer. </p>
        <p>The exact aesthetic values of the future which we are raised with are very important. Looking at films like
            Tomorrowland for guidance, you will find that classic utopian visions have large green open spaces and white
            organic skyscrapers are at the forefront -- a future which implies reconnecting with our biological nature.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, similar &amp; benign-seeming futures advertised on development placards feature the
            &quot;promenade&quot;, the &quot;commons&quot;: these place consumers at the panoptic center of attention,
            the eyes of storefronts and in the eyes of others. If there is nature, it is always subservient to man and
            subservient to consumption.</p>
        <p>Baudrillard: Pleasure is now the citizen&#39;s duty. This is the principle of the maximization of existence
            by the mutliplication of contacts and relations, by the extensive use of signs and objects, and by the
            systematic exploitation of all the possibilities of pleasure.</p>
        <p>Pleasure &amp; desire is equivalent to the traditional Marxist constraint of labor &amp; production. ...
            <i>[Modern man] will be gently and instantly reminded that he has no right not to be happy.</i></p>
        <p>The puritan morality has warped into the FUN morality, whose imperative is enjoyment and the compelete
            exploitation of all the possibilities of being thrilled experiencing pleasure, and being gratified.</p>
        <p>Baudrillard sees credit as &quot;the systematic socioeconomic indotrination of forced economicizing and an
            economic calculus for generations of consumers who, in a life of subsistence, would have been unexploitable
            as a force of consumption.&quot;. </p>
        <p>Again drawing parallels between traditional marxist theory and consumer theory, Baudrillard claims that the
            current &quot;indoctrination into systematic and organized consumption is the equivalent and the extension,
            in the twentieth century, of the great indoctrination of the rural populations into industrial labor, which
            occurred throughout the nineteenth century.&quot;</p>
        <p>Calling progressive thinking the &quot;ideology of consumption&quot;, Baudrillard derides the idea that some
            decisive &quot;human revolution&quot; separates the Age of Production from the Age of Consumption. Instead,
            Production and Consumption are one and the same, aiding the expansion of productive forces worldwide. </p>
        <p>Citing a quote from Eisenhower on how the government&#39;s role should merely be to encourage consumer
            spending... Eisenhower implies that consumption, not being directly imposed, could effectively replace
            taxation as a social levy.</p>
        <p>The consumer is consripted and mobilized as a laborer, consumption is social labor, the consumer is the
            Universal Being at the end of the human species the People are venerated by democracy the same way the
            Public are venerated by business: given that they do not choose to interfere politically or socially.</p>
        <h4 id="thoughts-on-consumer-society">thoughts on consumer society</h4>
        <p>I feel that this section falls flat. The power of consumption, of fulfilling material needs such as buying a
            new TV or car, is far overemphasized. There is a contradiction in that YOLO-- the pleasure morality, the
            morality which ostensibly fuels spending on material goods -- actually supports saving. Because saving for
            retirement, for experiences is so necessary and drilled into the minds of millenials/ gen Zrs, and because
            people would rather buy TIME with money (anti-work movement, four day work weeks) than material improvement,
            our consumption is not Baudrillard&#39;s.</p>
        <p>Instead our consumption seems increasing fueled by cultural affirmation. Lying on the empty floor of an
            American Room staring into a phone after doing the bare minimum, what we crave is direct validation through
            affirmation, infinite and instantaneous X-tok subcultural affirmations as opposed to the friction-laden and
            socially dubious act of material consumption. </p>
        <p>The idea of the &quot;niche internet microcelebrity&quot; and creation as consumption supports this same
            idea, that what Tiktok is good at doing is creating subcultures, the infrastructure for two-way validations
            in likes and followers. It blurs the gap between creator and consumer more than any other phenomenon to
            date.</p>

            communicates by a button board. She knows her friends by name, understands the time of day, remembers
            things, is curious about what a "dog" is... It makes a pretty convincing case that we have not seriously

        <h3>excerpts from the <i>Special Forces Survival Guide</i></h3>
        <p> along the same lines <a href="blog#4">as below</a>, two quotes from a wilderness
            survival book I got when I was eleven:</p>
        <blockquote>Shelter is the vital physical barrier between you and a hostile outer world.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>A survival diet is about eating everything you need to supply critical energy and nutrition.
        </blockquote>
        The idea of being able to eat whatever you want to survive is at odds with society and our natural empathy
        towards others. See Simone Weil's "sympathetic starvation" and Chris Kraus's <i>Aliens and Anorexia</i>
        <blockquote>After joining the French Resistance in London and toiling tirelessly for the cause, she came down
            with tuberculosis; in a remarkable gesture of solidarity, despite the doctor’s orders to eat heartily, she
            consumed only what was rationed to her compatriots under the German Occupation. Most scholars believe that
            this sympathetic starvation was the cause of Weil’s death. </blockquote>

        <h3 id="ivyleague"> Note on "Break up the Ivy League Cartel"</h3>
        <p><a
                href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/break-up-the-ivy-league-cartel">https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/break-up-the-ivy-league-cartel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>BIG is a very well known Substack centered around monopoly power, and they recently had a guest writer write
            about how the "Ivy League Cartel" threatens American democracy. While it is clear that the selection process
            at elite universities is flawed, the premise of this article is very wrong. </p>
        The exclusivity of the Ivy League is not wrecking the democratization of education, because what differentiates
        Ivy League schools is not the quality of education.
        <p>Something that is common knowledge for college applicants is that the quality of education does not differ
            meaningfully between many schools. The value of elite universities is college experience, connections, and
            prestige. </p>
        This following quote is especially problematic. It implies that the increased selectivity of elite colleges is
        somehow directly responsible for a decline in the quality of public education:

        <blockquote>
            There is no way that I know of to have truly democratic elections without widely available and high-quality
            public education. As everyone knows, the consolidation of wealth by elite, mostly private, schools has gone
            hand-in-hand with damaging political campaigns that have weakened even the country’s greatest public
            universities, such the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the University of California-Berkeley, for
            example.
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="survival">the simulation of self-sufficiency in survival fiction is an existential plea</h3>
        <p>Something not given enough attention is the link between survival literature (boxcart children, my side of
            the mountain, gary paulsen&#39;s hatchet, bear grylls ... chris mccandles?) and the existential/absurd
            perspective. To kids growing up who the rules of society didn't seem to make sense, survival fiction
            provides a welcome escape. </p>
        <p>This basic human desire for simplicity (which is the same as confronting the existential, which is the same
            as denial of death) is reflected in either an attempt for RATIONALIZATION (le corbusier desire for
            legibility aka <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">seeing
                as a state</a>) or an attempt for IRRATIONALIZATION, fatalistic detachment through an artificial return
            to wilderness survival. The first is the dismissal of the unexplainable from the world, the second is
            disassociating the unexplainable from oneself. </p>
        <p>Both are pleas for the world to make sense.</p>

            View the paper here in the Journal of Controversial Ideas: <a
                href="https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/1/1/132">https://journalofcontroversialideas.org/article/1/1/132</a>
        </p>
        <p>Abstract:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Life is pointless. That’s not okay. I show that. I argue that a point is a valued end and that, as
                agents, it makes sense for us to want our efforts and enterprises to have a point. Valued ends provide
                justifying reasons for our acts, efforts, and projects. I further argue that ends lie separate from the
                acts and enterprises for which they provide a point. Since there can be no end external to one’s entire
                life since one’s life includes all of one’s ends, leading and living one’s life as a whole cannot have a
                point. Finally, I argue that since we live our lives and structure our living­a­human­life efforts both
                in parts and as a whole, it is fitting to be sad to recognize that leading and living a life is
                pointless. My discussion helps make sense of the literature that frequently talks around this topic but
                often does so vaguely and indirectly.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The main argument:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We cannot possibly have a point to leading a life because valued ends (points) are external to the
                projects toward which they are directed.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some strong arguments, esp. about many abstract/altruistic values as delaying the problem of life having a
            point. But I don&#39;t agree at all because I don&#39;t think that &quot;having a point&quot; for life is
            the same as &quot;having a point&quot; for an action within life.</p>
        <p>I think Rivka&#39;s response to the category mistake objection is fatally flawed.</p>
        <p>This is the category mistake objection:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We might consider asking for the point of life, or being sad that there isn’t one, to be a category
                mistake, akin to asking, “When is a potato?” or being sad that your baby has a name but not a number, or
                that your nose is neither odd nor even.</p>
            <p>Seeking the “when” of a potato or the oddness or evenness of a nose is incoherent; potatoes and noses are
                not the kinds of things that have times or oddness/evenness. It is incoherent to demand that of them and
                nonsensical to bemoan the fact that your nonsensical demands cannot be met. When we ask what the point
                of life is and are sad to discover that life can’t have a point, are we making a category mistake? Are
                we nonsensically bemoaning an incoherence?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>And this is her defense:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I don’t think so. Leading a human life is an effort or enterprise we all engage in, just as we engage in
                many other projects within our human lives. It can then come as a disappointing surprise to note that,
                unlike many other of our purposeful enterprises, leading life itself cannot have a point. Asking whether
                life is pointless is not incoherent—we understand the question and are capable of sensibly answering it;
                we just may not like the answer.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The strength of the category mistake objection is that it says, NOT finding a point does not make something
            pointless. The attribute of having a &quot;point&quot; does not apply to life itself when our idea of what a
            &quot;point&quot; could constitute is informed entirely by the points of actions within life. <br> <br> She
            never answers this.</p>
        <p>Because of this category mistake, I think that &quot;the point&quot; for life as a whole is not its effect,
            as is &quot;the point&quot; for individual actions, but rather the point is to live stories/ have
            experiences which are timeless. The ends of life as a whole, to the extent that we engage in life as an
            effort or enterprise <i>of its own</i> (which, again, is not the same way we engage in individual
            actions), are timeless.</p>
        <p>Stepping back a bit, my own view (which I think is fairly conventional) is that closed loops of value make
            individual actions intrinsically meaningful, and all of life is composed of these individual actions,
            meaning that living as a whole is meaningful. This objection, akin to dismissing Zeno&#39;s Paradox (Rivka
            is saying how can anything move? Of course things can move!!), is also addressed in a section titled
            &quot;The Fallacy of Composition&quot;. She says:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>One might object that seeking a point to living at all is an instance of the fallacy of composition,
                i.e., of attributing to the whole what is true of the parts. <b>But, as argued, life is an effort or
                    enterprise that we engage in both in parts and as an effort or enterprise of its own.</b> It
                therefore makes sense for us to want that effort to have a point because it is the valued ends toward
                which our efforts are directed that serve to help us justify or makes sense of those efforts.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Minor objection to the above: Life itself is not an effort of its own. Every effort within life is an action
            within it. </p>
        <p>However, as far as life itself must be construed to have some kind of overarching aim (and I agree that there
            is some expectation in this sense, although I still don&#39;t think the attribute of &quot;having a
            point&quot; applies in the same way), the best argument against this that I can think of comes from this
            quote from <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/stanislaw-lems-reflections-childhood/">Stanislaw
                Lem&#39;s Reflections on the Objects of His Childhood Home</a>: <i>“Each experience has its weight, its
                authority, which does not admit of argument and depends only on itself.”</i> </p>
        <p><i>The purpose which we extract from our life structure is not due to its effect</i>. It is not causal in
            the sense of an individual valued end or &quot;point&quot; immediately following it in time. Instead, the
            value, which Rivka acknowledges as well, comes from what is termed the &quot;narrative trajectory of human
            life&quot;, or what I will term the story which stands independent of time. While a story takes the form of
            a cause and an effect, the <i>value of the story</i> is akin to aesthetic/experience, and is detached from
            time. Timeless fairy tales, archetypal/prototypical figures etc.</p>
        <p>The reason that our own expectation-fulfillment drive for life-as-story are not the same kind of goal as
            eating five tomatoes (a fulfillable drive) is because our own experiences are in the frame of our life as a
            whole. &quot;I want to be the kind of person who goes skydiving before they die&quot; is a continual,
            life-long drive which will NOT be fulfilled by going skydiving.</p>
        <p>One possible objection to this claim I just made, &quot;that the value of the life is in living
            stories&quot;, is that striving to appear a certain way is a fundamentally a social phenomenon. In response,
            I actually think that this value is mostly convincing <i>yourself</i> that you are a certain kind of
            person or a figure within another narrative. And that you will be until the day you die.</p>
        <p>(With this way of thinking of living stories as having timeless value, I am taking the stance that all of
            this value is human defined. Without the knowledge of life stories this point for life would not exist,
            perhaps in a hypothetical Edenic paradise)</p>
        <p>This idea of timeless story value also answers the defense against the &quot;Everyday Meaning
            Objection&quot;:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Recall: if I work as a lawyer fighting for civil rights, for example, the point of my efforts is justice,
                which is part of my Everyday Meaning. But justice cannot serve as the point of leading my life, even if
                we think of our overall efforts as necessary conditions for my Everyday Meaningful fight for justice, as
                I will notice by imagining justice achieved,—then what? What is the point of the rest of my life?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The continual drive to be someone who fights for justice is the Universal Meaning behind the Everyday Meaning
            of justice. And that won't stop. Preserving the story of your life requires constant vigilance.</p>
        <p>To summarize: Rivka&#39;s whole argument for the pointlessness of life is based on the point being external
            to the action:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The point of building a hut, like all points, will lie outside the hut, as we have noted. But
                there’s nothing external to your life to serve as the point of leading and living it because your life
                includes your whole damn life.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But there is something external! Externality only involves time (the &quot;after&quot;) when the desired
            state (of your family, of politics, of the world) in question are themselves subject to time. When the
            objects themselves, stories/experiences, are independent of time, they can be an external valued end in
            themselves without being subject to time; without coming &quot;after&quot;. Life can and does have an
            external point because the point of life is not causal like individual actions in life.</p>

            only 21; my eyes should be bluish-white, instead they’re bloodshot.

        <h3 id="tiktok">Response: Kneeling Bus's <a
                href="https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/157-this-must-be-the-place">"This Must Be the Place"</a></h3>
        <p> When I originally read this piece I was impressed by the way it encapsulated my feelings of disenchantment
            about the relationship of the Internet to the physical world. </p>
        <p>In particular, the following quotes stuck out to me. The first is the recognition that suburbia is not a
            fleeting circumstance to be transcended, but remains the defining aesthetic in America:</p>
        <blockquote> If you grow up in the suburbs, a familiar experience is going over to a friend’s house for the
            first time and recognizing its layout as identical to that of another friend’s house you’ve already visited,
            if not your own house...This experience of recurrence mirrors other patterns that predominate in suburban
            (and increasingly, urban) environments: the ready-made familiarity of chain stores and restaurants that
            you’ve already encountered elsewhere, only distinguished by slight variations, appearing in similar clusters
            throughout a metropolitan area. </blockquote>
        The second describes what Kneeling Bus calls "post-spatial space" (a term I personally don't like), and is from
        Paul Ford's <a href="https://medium.com/message/the-american-room-3fce9b2b98c5"> The American Room</a>: </p>
        <blockquote> “The people dancing and talking and singing in beige rooms with 8' ceilings are surrounded by
            standards, physically and online. Technological standards like HTML5 also allow us to view web pages and
            look at video over the Internet. All of their frolic is bounded by a set of conventions that are essentially
            invisible yet define our national physical and technological architecture. Their dancing, talking bodies are
            the only non-standardized things in the videos.
        </blockquote>
        Finally, this last quote paints a dystopian vision of the future:
        <blockquote>Earlier this month a house in Santa Monica, currently on the market for $5 million, became available
            to TikTok influencers, who can apply to spend two hours filming amid its pool and amenities as long as they
            help market the house in their videos.The process by which Airbnb transformed shelter into a liquid
            commodity might similarly transform content creation sites, which is to say that humans and content will
            soon have to compete for housing.</blockquote>
        <p> Here are several (pretty convincing) defenses of Instagram/Tiktok in response, mostly from my friend <a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/claire._y/">Claire Yang</a>:</p>
        <p><i>This hunt for common experience is not a bad thing. Instagrammability results in cute cafes and pink
                brick walls. Is it really a dystopia when your life resembles a pinterest board?. People use Pinterest
                as a way to intentionally work towards having their life mimic internet pictures. They explicitly agree
                to this and enjoy it.</i></p>
        <p><i>Fashion isn't frozen. Tiktok content creators understand homogenization better than outsiders and strive
                to avoid it. They are not trapped into anything. Much of internet culture is making fun of basic and
                outdated attempts to fit in. </i></p>
        <p><i>Saying that "humans and content will soon have to compete for housing" is hyperbole. The interests of
                rich influencers have always trumped poorer people, and different types of buildings serve different
                purposes.</i></p>
        <p><i>Lastly, caring about something like the American Room is elitist. Beige 8' rooms look rather nice. (the
                recognition of its existence is good though)</i></p>
        <p>I'm not sure if the author meant to come off as negative (he does seem to strive to be impartial). At any
            rate, I still really like the article for what it brings attention to. </p>

        <h3>April 23rd <span class="tt">2021 CE</span></h3>
        <h3>aesthetic altruism</h3>
        The Tumblr crowd is not so different from the Hacker News crowd. Both draw people who are intensely fascinated
        with the texture of life, mostly introverts. Then I think the (usually) male impulse for self-sacrifice causes
        the two to diverge. <br><br>

        I can't help but see engineers, who are predominately male, as aesthetics altruists. They are the only ones who
        get to build cities, bridges, to set the scene for human life, but always at the curse of knowledge which makes
        their creations banal for themselves. That is the irony to their idealism: at the end of the promise of the true
        realization of their dreams they end up having to sacrifice them, no longer able to see anything other than
        plumbing and shear loads. <br> <br>

        In this sense I guess you cannot really make something for yourself. In the process of making you are inevitably
        drawn into a different, sadder understanding of your creation than the consumer. The architect of the temple can
        never be the excited visitor whom he designs for. No one wants to do the work, we all want to live in worlds of
        other peoples' making, for life to happen to us; but without acts of aesthetic altruism, of self-sacrifice, none
        of it would ever be real. <br>

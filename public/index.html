            <p>(5.11.2025)
                I finished reading *Collapse* by Jared Diamond. The descriptions of historical collapses of civilization were engrossing. Shifting to present-day issues made the problems described far less fantastical and more politically urgent. Separate from the technology, the brutal reality of wells running dry and the water table getting lower and lower is how environmental management works in practice. This may be very wrong, but it seems that caring about the environment is *the* basic commitment of anyone who is concerned with more than economic reality.

                There's an intoxicating feeling of power you get when you realize that a certain kind of thing that has seemed vague and difficult for a number of unrelated reasons reduces to a ton of work (a precisely articulated network of concepts), it's almost a creatively enriching process but not quite. In the other direction educational outflows establish negative ground, so that it's possible to make something out by viewing work from a far distance but not from up close.

                I really will have time to work on my projects. I did so the most my sophomore year, less freshman year because I was knocked down by the immediate realities of artistic machinery, in a limited capability my junior fall, and really not at all this spring semester. As frequently stated here, I will be more patient with myself but not make as many mistakes.

            <p>(4.10.2025) A lot of the excitement of college is in the idea that there are an infinite number of possibilities ahead of you. On realizing that there is one real life that you will truly be able to live out, it is up to you to decorate it the best way you can. A lot of my time this semester has been doing proofs or various forms of rigorous writing, in part because I've usually been able to color in or sketch in gaps alright. What this has led me to realize again is that writing tight and restrained is not writing well, and omitting subjects when speaking near holds listeners in contempt. 在中文课里我们学到了形容/内容的差异，相比较英文 'the map on the wall' 跟据 '墙上的地图', 然我先到广大无边的考试文化，一简化的陈述到词句到生词。举起的手，一个问题的答案，对和错。

                It surprises me still, the endless depth and variety of intelligible communication which could not have come out of a fully conscious mind. </p>
            <p>(4.10.2025) Finished <i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley and almost finished <i>The Silent Patient</i> by Alex Michaelides, which was recommended out of the blue. Enjoying <i>Two House</i> by Food House. <br><br>
            I saw a sign for a restaurant that said "Pizza Works" with a picture of a pizza with the crust cut into little gears. It was completely nonsensical but a joy to witness. </p>
            <p>(4.3.2025) All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling -- seriously? Seriously? Seriously? This is the most easily falsifiable statement in the world. </p>

            <p>(3.31.2025) On second thought, it's probably the pens. <br><br>
            Read <i>White Noise</i> over break. It was a remarkably styled book, reminded me of George Saunders. A lot of conversational cliffs and incredibly specific descriptions. This is the realism described by Ayn Rand she strives to avoid. Started <i>The Power Broker</i>, about an urban planner called Robert Moses. </p>
            <p>(3.30.2025) In general, my drawings have been trending starker and bleaker and stranger since freshman year, but it's good. Not presupposing ideal bodies. Not intentional deprivation in search of motivation. I wondered what the purpose of a conversation was: what it could reveal about someone or something. The closest thing I could come up with was the process of drawing from nothing. It's a good description because when the topic itself is nonexistent: a comparison of processes, instead of circling around a great big empty space. <br> <br> What do you see when you see "exit"? What do you think of when you say someone is creative? </p>

            <p>(3.8.2025) Only on the internet is there an illusion of omnipresence or a complete sincerity of presence. It's more than a little paradoxical.</p>
            <p>(3.6.2025) I think for the first time since freshman fall I'm taking five intensive classes where I could spend at least twice the amount of time on each and learn about that much more: entrepreneurship, real analysis, DS & algorithms, algorithmic aspects of ML, and chinese. This has come at the expense of creative time. The best way I've figured out to deal with this is to try to minimize the amount of context switching and not look for similarities between my classes (other than really shallow things like both algorithms classes talking about bloom filters) because unfortunately doing so is a kind of creative work. </p>

            <p>(3.5.2025）I'm pretty excited about the upcoming months. I haven't really spent time consistently working on projects this semester and it's turned out alright. Something that really bothered me in the last couple years would be someone describing what they do as a puzzle, just because I've never seen truly challenging and rewarding problems described that way. It's a problem with how I view puzzles I guess. </p>

                A rich mind, brimming mind uncaught. quantity has a quality all its own. By quantity I mean repetition. By repetition I mean taking steps to stay alive. I could catch a salmon, I could bite a dog.A flat terror of logic being forced into the ground. ADP prance logic four. Gotten without whimsy, gifted, unfortunately. Cotton unbrushed lips which tellers understood informally. Unclaimed self-subscribed flinching. This is shape cutting. Said then not around kept waiting, those gluttons. A coarse shadow of mine tied to the outward ceiling. Then actual reinforced gunmetal bouncing clear, but tended towards blueity. When incapable amusement barred against all others, not a word was left unsaid.

            <p>(2.20.2025) One of my ideas from SBI in spring of 2024 was to develop a kind of virtual world by patching together 3D spheres from different apartment listings online. You could have little coins and scavenger hunts or make it a speedrun challenge to explore all of the rooms as fast as possible. I wnder if this would be pitchable to BRGD.</p>

            <p>(2.5.2025) The way that the conntations of "locked-in" has changed from negative, externally imposed constraints to positive, internal constraints is fascinating.</p>
            <p>(2.5.2025) Your sense of a plot is directly related to the degree to which you can control, or predict, or retrospectively understand, some thread or object or process within your life.</p>
            <p>(2.1.2025) My drawings have been pretty bad lately. I learned to compose accurately, and then gradually added abstraction. I would think of an process or object, and it would gradually arise out of drawing unrelated things. Now my choices are abstraction, realism, or landscapes, none of which are what I want to do. Charcoal helps a good deal. But it's still an issue with the medium. </p>
            <p>(2.1.2025) Here is a very true statement, nevertheless in which room for interpretation is great: <i>History is the production and reproduction of real life</i>. What you call <i>real life</i> is not what I would, but what history promises, in one way or another, is the ability to see how others felt. What <i>production</i> and <i>reproduction</i> reflect could be artificial and natural processes, life and art etc. Perhaps it is the sense of situation which reproduction replicates, while production fails to capture. Maybe <i>production</i> is doing too much work, but can't you imagine what it means? An orchestra, a factory, a game of chess. What is articulated in the statement is the expressive potential of history, an ambition which stretches your hands behind your head and tries to touch the ground. </p>
            <p>(1.26.2025) The Atlantic: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/</a>">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/</a>. I don't think loneliness is not the right way to characterize the issue, nor political moderation or social neededness. The idea of cohesion is a little better: maybe it's the lack of a good feeling of inertia. </p>
            <p>(1.21.2025) Articulation is not the most important thing.</p>

            <p> (1.21.2025) You will take the flag and throw it onto the ledge, and take the ledge and turn it inside out. And then scoop the water out from underneath your feet, and curl your toes to make spaces for the ripples to pass beneath, and move your fingers back, press them against your sides, open up your core against the locked boxes on the shoreline. Don't wear the shirts ...
                <br> <br> ... who is unable to create a box with your own thinking, a box which describes itself and a paper which describes its own body. A delicious beautiful body, a body of coiled steel, a charged, idealistic shape of planes and circuits, which wrap and tangle with the lives of the rich and the beautiful, the beautiful faces which have more than beautiful smiles, which are able to go beyond the current spaces in which people live and define a new kind of hierarchy within which I live alone. VIsitors are allowed but only with the bell. Only with the chime, entrance and deference to the sky ... 
                <br> <br> ... the ferocious and not entirely sanitized burn could somehow go into the boxes of arithmetical thinking, without attestation or tuning. The transformation of a large and wide object into a thin and forceable shape. The sharpening of a mind on a stone which is turned inwards. The focus on a subject which is truly hard.</p>

            <p>(12.17.2024) <i>The first handbook for Scoutmasters, published in 1912, promised that new boy members would be instinctively interested in their first outdoor troop meeting becaguse they “are yearning to know their world. To unlock the mysteries of nature and to know their relationship to them.” The author, though, cut short any suggestion that the purpose for Scouts’ discovery of nature’s mysteries might be spiritual growth, “They must learn to recognize the forces and the laws of operation which underlie the manifestations of nature. Their wonder and interest must not be satisfied with the mystery and romance of it all but their ability to use and master these forces must be impressed upon them. This mastery will give knowledge and power for later life-work.”</i> </p>

                            Consider the garden path sentence, "the new doctor offered the operation appeared increasingly likely to succeed in her career". The selectional constraints which "offered" poses on the new doctor, as opposed to the operation, is the primary driver of ambiguity in the sentence: the typicality of the verb with the doctor as subject, as opposed to the operation as object. The respective main and reduced clause frames could be formulated as standalone sentences, and then compared by both humans and language models: for instance, reading times could be measured and surprisal could be calculated for "the new doctor offered the experiment to patients" and "the new doctor offered the experiment succeeded in his career". Then, these ratios could be compared: if there exists high variability of the ratio across different examples sharing a syntactic structure, e.g. the Main Verb/Reduced Relative, it is evidence that reading times are affected by the selectional constraints of the verb, irrespective of the underlying syntactic structure.

            This semester was probably the first one in which I have set hard word limits for myself, and found my writing enriched by it.

            <p>(11.27.2024) One of my commonly reoccurring thoughts is how much effort you need to put into speaking in order to be understood. My linguistics professor is extremely cautious about using effort as a distinguishing factor between utterances. So, I'm not sure if this is a universal feeling.</p>
            <p>(11.12.2024) My instincts for self-sufficiency are spreading me too thin. My "thoroughness". When I heard myself described this way I immediately thought of the many times I've penciled in a shape completely black, because that's the failsafe for iteration.</p>
            <p>(11.5.2024) I love design. What I meant by this is unfortunately not related to user experience. But I still love it.</p>

            <p>(10.29.2024) The <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/" >socialexplorer</a> viewer is very well-designed, it uses a visuals to communicate common actions like locating the user, and downloading the map without language. Part of my job at the Brown Library is to revise tutorials for clarity and ease of communication, and as part of that I ended up trying to download little svg icons from the interface to reference in the tutorial. The issue was that they were dynamically rendered --  and it turns out many of them are actually part of a TrueType font linked on the website! I worked with Fontforge for the <a href="sonority.html">sonority</a> project, but getting it to work with python was tricky. Anyways, here are some of the outputs<br>

            <p>(10.22.2024)  The thrill of a stopped escalator or an empty hallway is in transgression, not against the clocks of other people but your own. If you can coolly dissect the mechanisms of progress you can transcend them, or at least act them out in full self-consciousness. That is to say, it obviously a terrible guide for living, but it is a truth all on its own.

And yet we might say that stories, like people, have a way of binding in more than any body, single or corporate, intends.</p>

            <p>(9.23.2024) I am going to be so busy this week. I need an outlet to say things. I don't think Narrative Nonfiction is filling that gap, particularly because I agree my pitches last week weren't great, and I feel the pull of writing for an audience. I'm noticeably better at expressing "thoughts" in writing, but there's a reason I didn't like to do that before. Something to circle back and touch base on</p>

            <p>(9.19.2024) I feel safe swimming around in sealed circles, where my applications of meaning tend to be very clear. This works for my blog, which is a place for me to talk to myself. But wow, sometimes it feels so shallow. I've made the observation before in Screen-based Images, but when you always operate from a place of self-reflection, it's hard to avoid "cashing out" on yourself. If I want to write longer pieces, better put them somewhere else as well. </p>
            <p>(9.19.2024) <i>Tender is the Flesh</i> feels like a thought experiment which has frozen over in every direction except gratuitous violence, but there's a passage that describes someone's words as boxes full of blank paper. </p>

            <p> (9.15.2024) The Splintered Mind says on <a href="http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2024/09/the-disunity-of-consciousness-in.html ">unity of experience</a> that "our ordinary condition, before rare unifying introspective and reflective actions, involves degrees of partial, imperfect unity, rather than complete unity or complete disunity". But I don't think anyone actually believes in complete <i>unity of experience</i>. Rosenthal talks about the unity of consciousness. I think that more complete unities correspond to greater aesthetic satisfaction, and that there is a notion of periodicity, or wavelength, in the process of this achievement which is as least as definite as emotions are. The methods of accomplishing unity are independent of higher-order thoughts, but thought can guide practice, so that you can actively desire unity and get better at achieving it.</p>

                    Watching <i>Fire of Love</i> made me realize my tendency to perceive agony in many landscapes. There's no reason for this perception, its plausibly a product of natural selection (which is hardly better than no explanation). From a cultural perspective, it could be a vestige of ascribing moral values to wilderness (as opposed to what?) <br><br>
                    Whatever its causes are, it definitely goes beyond both the purely aesthetic and purely geographic. The natural is not separable from the self. <br><br>

                [Spoilers] Hunger (2023) is centered around two characters: one is Auy, a young female cook who runs her family noodle shop. The other is the European-looking Chef Paul and his famous catering service known as "Hunger". It is set in contemporary Thailand. Many of the comments made reflect the aspirations and fears of young adults there and elsewhere: Auy's stability in running the family business against the inability to pursue into any other career, nepotism at large firms denying promotions, the insubstantial nature of wealth as it is created virtually, through online content creation or cryptocurrency empires. <br><br>
                This film goes beyond the flagrantly satirical elements of "The Menu" to provide a much more human look at the relationship between a chef and his clients. It might not be more realistic, but it resonated with me on more levels. It raised questions about what a dream is, how hard it is to hold fulfillment and desire at once, and how happiness viewed from this perspective is empty: how "wish-fulfillment" is necessarily an outside diagnosis and not a true description. This made me think more about what has been called my "obsession with technology". I've felt that my desire has been to find perspectives which are the most true to form, but this is very easily the most *intuitive* perspective instead of the most *true*. The difference between a sport and a game how strong something is at its core: the delineations of a sport provides a stable foundation for strategy whereas a game is built around and between those strategies. I'm not going to think too much about this anymore but something something incremental developments enable gamification true technology is a leveler.  <br><br>
                Anyways. In the final catering scene, Chef Paul and Auy are brought together to compete on three intersecting areas of culinary skill, authenticity, and self-image: Auy crafts a narrative, not around her as a woman breaking barriers in a male-dominated industry but around familial love and understanding through food. Chef Paul then brutalizes this narrative by serving hundreds of identical bowls of hot water, and giving a one and a half sentence speech on "common humanity". The crowd flocks from one to the next, unable to distinguish heartfelt messages from cynically delivered platitudes.  <br><br>
                The final words of Tone to Auy ("Isn't *this*$^1$ what *you*$^2$ hungered for?") could be interpreted as a very traditional kind of mockery$^1$, very cynical and self-defeating. But Tone has been a supporter of Auy throughout the film: he wants her to succeed and believes that she wants to. That tinges the scene with the sadness of misunderstanding$^2$. If Tos provides Auy the ability to become a viral sensation, Tone provides Auy with the ability to differentiate sensation from reality, a baseline which forces her to reevaluate her priorities. She realizes that Chef Paul cannot possibly be serving his clients out of love: they will always be the objects of affection, capable of endless absorption of love, time, and skill, and polite (monetary) reciprocation. Instead of continuing to work towards understanding, she chooses to return to her family business.  <br><br>
                The pace of the ending music is unsettling, and it does not indicate a traditional happy ending as many believe. Nothing has been resolved: popularity and tradition are still at odds. She cannot cook for her community without drawing attention, attention which will change her and her clientele. Aun knows this, and believes even her efforts to restore her family kitchen will inevitably involve compromise and division.

                    "Voice" is both a personal and a social issue. To hold fragmentary experiences together in time requires the capacity to step back from the power of each event to hurt or disorien. Sheer surrender to the moment weakens one's voice. the capcity to stand in and out of a situation at the same time is a practical strategy for survival. <br><br>
                    Where life narratives in which difference has been experienced on informal, open-ended, and cooperative terms become what the anthropologist Clifford Geertz once called "thick descriptions", the narrator is conveying a more complex, and engaging, social reality.</p>

You are made to consider a peculiar relationship, the one which you have with your toothpaste or your swimsuit or your car brakes, in the captivity of reading or listening. Then you might go to the store (or not) and in a couple months the seasonal reports come in. And then they think, "I shouldn't have put a comma there".

                I want to take a serious writing class in college. My writing has regressed to frantic little notes to myself on my computer and regurgitated logic and ideas for two of my classes. I am proud of my reading lately, been finding some really great books and articles. And I am proud of several projects from this semester and last, some of which I will try to post here.

                So much of college comes down to reading (better) and writing (better). Again, really hard to say what that means exactly.

                The way words are distributed is really interesting. I've got this notion in my head that they've replaced people except in the settings where people really care about conversations, which may make talking a lot less interesting. Words are a proof something was done, and at the highest level we care a lot about sending those signals. But there's a difference between billboards and toothpaste labels because the billboards are actually meant for reading, whereas toothpaste are more forced compliance. <br> <br>

Watched [sic] yesterday, by Melissa Gibson and performed by Something on the Green. The ambitions in sic are very different from conventional ambition, but they still suffer from the same limitations. Frank is training to become an auctioneer; Theo is composing songs for a theme park ride. Babette is writing a history book about outbursts of anger. I really like Frank's character.
<br> <br>
auctioneering brings to mind the detached, clinical sounds of the airport intercom, the weatherman, social roles that are all transitory or relational. They carry information which is of no particular importance except to their audience. Through a singular focus on the subjects, they make no claims on masculine or feminine identity, or the presence of a speaker. To train as an auctioneer, Frank repeats tongue twisters over and over. He isolates language as a gender-neutral force, phonetic constraints overriding purposeful language.

                    objectively weighted cost; you could be a disorganized person but not care much, or be organized and
                    care a lot. If you've 1. lost something and 2. decided to look for it, you've made the judgement
                    that your time is worth searching for it. Same idea as prison or proportional fines.

                <p>(10.18.2023) I've been busy but feeling very on top of things recently. It's a combination of knowing
                    what problems not to waste time on, and sticking through hard things I know how to do. Speaking of
                    which, I am itching to work on some kind of technical dev project. I need to put my foot in my mouth

                <p>(9.28.2023) Roughly: many people have goals, but also expectations. The expectations may be very
                    different from their goal, but critically they do not differ in intent. For example, neuroscience is
                    about discovering the secrets of consciousness; it is also about sticking probes in mice brains. I
                    am happy when my expectations are forced to change; that is, when something I look at is not what I
                    think it is. I believe art is about changing expectations. I think that goals are more
                    environmentally dependent than expectation.</p>
                <p>(9.28.2023) A good deal of learning is in the teacher conceptualizing themselves as a student
                    and probing for weak and impoverished forms. An effective teacher needs a lot of input,
                    and the ability to improvisationally prompt the student.

                    Silverman Abstract Algebra preliminary:
                    for every x, there exists y: "your opponent hands you a value of x and you need to find a winning
                    value of y" <br>
                    vs <br>
                    there exists y for every x: "you choose a y, and that y needs to win regardless of the x your
                    opponent chooses" <br><br>

                <p>(9.10.2023) We can trace the positive connotations of "slay" from the semantics of the earlier
                    phrase, "killed it". There are other areas where recycling of slang fragments (might) be at play,
                    most recently "cooking" as an action verb from "cooking something up"; most commonly used as "s/he's
                    cooking". I think that the recycling phenomenon is in general motivated by the desire to seem "one
                    step ahead": that someone both understands what "killed it" or "cooking something up" means, and
                    that they reject it for a shorter, snappier version that makes sense only in that original context.

                        There is a problem: nuclear detonations are a hostile environment for precision instruments.
                        This is the central challenge of underground testing. In atmospheric testing, instruments can be
                        located far enough away from ground zero to survive the detonation (we will see an example of
                        this later). For underground tests, the radius of destruction is relatively small, but it
                        contains far too much soil and rock for remote instruments to be useful. Instead, most of the
                        measurements must be taken from the same shaft as the device.

                    <i>
                        To resolve this conundrum, engineers had to dance very closely with the destruction. It is
                        simply the nature of underground nuclear testing that the measurement instruments will be
                        destroyed almost instantly. They must collect their data and report it before the blast reaches
                        them. Every underground test was a remarkable race: as the blast propagated through the
                        canister, each instrument produced a signal which traveled through cables to safety just ahead
                        of the advancing shockwave. Cables were turned to vapor just behind the messages they carried.

                We code motion verbs from spontaneous narratives from the Eugene Children’s Story Corpus as manner ("walked") or path ("went"). We find that manner verb usage is predictable by PPVT (a verbal intelligence test) while path verb usage is not, suggesting manner verbs are a unique category in acquisition.

                <p>(4.30.2023) Finished <i>Replay</i>. Having fun with my second squib. </p>
                <p>(4.24.2023) Read <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> and <i>Information doesn't want to be Free</i>, both of which I enjoyed. My classes are all wrapping up their lectures, so I get to spend time studying and working on my final projects which is very rewarding. I'm going to prioritize my Deep Learning project, my Lexical Semantics squibs, and my metaethics final paper. I don't think my stats notes are really worth covering further. Reading my morality notes really confuses me because of how dense it is but I'd still like to publish something from it.<br><br>
                What I really love and want to explore with linguistics is the mechanics of abstraction. Not a foreign language, a fixed abstraction, but absolutely the math and absolutely the philosophy of it. To look at something and see all of its truly different interpretations. When I was little my ideas of mathematical kinds were were very naive. I would think of x and 2x just as fundamentally different as x and x^2. I had no imagination (does anyone?), I adored linearity and simple geometry because it was easy to check my work. <br><br>
                On the balance, I think I am learning to check my naivete. Accepting that my intuition is simultaneously my strongest and least productive tool (but almost exactly my source of aesthetic joy). If you always explore you will never exploit.

                <p>(4.13.2023) The bound reading is the sloppy reading. The free reading is the strict one.</p>

                    This is roughly like how a partition (bijection) puts all its elements (surjective) in disjoint subsets (injective). <br><br>

                    Schopenhauer claims that this book is all a single thought unfolding, which is not really true. <br />The central theme of the book would probably be something as simple as "the world is will as representation". <br /><br />Schopenhauer takes a strategy not unlike Descartes, where he deduces from a single fact a wide variety of things about the world. He basically says that there is only one thing with a truly intelligible internal representation, the human will, and that the body is the only link between the will and the real world. Because the will is what drives him, he believes that the world should all be thought of as a single, indivisible representation of the will. The will is before space, time, and causality; it is the thing-in-itself.<br /><br />Here's an question I had: Schopenhauer believes the will is before everything. This includes the concept of numbers. So how is it true that the will can be said to be one, indivisible, unique? The really cool thing is that uniqueness proofs are done without ever *counting*. An object x has properties P(x). To prove it is unique, we show that for all x' such that P(x') is true, x' is actually equal to x. We need not consider anything but the properties of single objects.<br /><br />Objections mainly to the argument of suitability (this was written before Darwin and Schopenhauer makes some very dubious claims about ecological niches), government, and the passages on pain and boredom. The central claim is in the two hundred pages and the rest doesn't really follow.

                    Diffusion models are like fossil fuels. They borrow from the future of digital content (the degradation to pure corrupted noise) to enrich the present, incurring time debt.

                <p>(3.22.2023) Is there a way to generate psuedorandom numbers that you can do in your head? This is an appealing and testable project.</p>
                <p> (3.22.2023) Happy with my work today on space logic lemmas. Want to start working on our pix2pix project, and I've been putting off writing a squib for lexical semantics! I started off strong with an analysis of "unalive" but don't really know where to go beyond saying "this word is a verb not a noun". I should go look at other "un" prefixable words, and maybe at the scalar implicature of "un" applied to those words. There's certainly "half-alive". Something REALLY cool I noticed today is that the scales for "very possible", "possible", "very probable" and "probable" are different. If it's possible to integrate this to the squib that would be fun! I also spent a bunch of time thinking about how adjectives are either relative and individual origins, but eventually concluded that okay fine they are still intersectional not subsectional. I just dislike the complexity.</p>
                <p>(3.19.2023) Maybe 1/3rd of the way through the world as will and representation. My notes look nice but are incomprehensible; same with most of my projects at the moment. Not sure how much of this is an increase in my own expectations versus genuine apathy. I should be doing more... </p>

                <p>(3.14.2023) Idea: app for <strike>runners</strike> me that doesn't just give you the closest bus route back, but the closest one that doesn't involve doubling back. It also calculates the arrival time closer to my running pace. </p>
                <p>
                    (3.11.2023) Alright, here we go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3.10.2023) The reason why I've fixated on word vectors was that they had a power of
                    unpredictability to them. Words are incredibly compressed, forceded meaning -- vectors have a power
                    to them that is like a summer storm. But deep learning is not about creating vectors, it's about
                    making predictions. And making predictions means being right. It requires a set of questions and a
                    set of answers. It requires predictability.

                    Vectors are the essence of all that is unpredictable and violent and messy about a language. And
                    their utilization is only as a stopgap for the predictable and the totally routine. It is harnessing
                    lightning in a bottle to power grain mills. I love the violence and the totally adrift. I love the
                    magic.

                    Can I make room in my heart for something else? It's hard when all you've done seems to tell you
                    that it can go on.

                    (2.1.2023) Well, Hack@Brown didn't go well, but I'm glad I went at all! My classes are so exciting:
                    lexical semantics, proofwriting, deep learning, morality, and stats (with theory!). I will have to
                    focus more in the next few weeks. Reading <i>Man and his Symbols</i>, <i>The Power and the
                        Glory</i>, some theory books from RISD, and still <i>Butcher's Crossing.</i>
                    Providence is beautifully austere, we've had a string of cold and sunny days and I discovered a

                    <i>Stoner</i> by John Williams. Stoner is an amazing book.

                </p>

                <p> (1.20.2023) I changed my mind, this format works fine. Just have to restabilize it. </p>
                <p> (12.23.2022) College is hard :) </p>
                <p> (10.3.2022) College is fun! </p>
                <p>(7.27.2022) I got COVID lol. I want to rewrite this website again because I'm not happy with a lot of
                    the content. I realized that most of the separate .html files are older works and that I actually
                    enjoyed the previous format a good amount, but I still want to have some visual non-gridified
                    aesthetic. </p>
                <p>(7.19.2022) I have this idea that solves the multiple meanings problem with language. Given four
                    equidistant points from a center point, they form a tetrahedron in 3D wordspace where each of the
                    points is at the intersection of three planes of meaning. This also generalizes to higher
                    dimensions, but with my current script producing four point/word/vectors I have
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        moneyball luncheon proponent alumna
                        belated position circumvented existential
                        neutropenia crimping invisible marsupial
                        ...
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
                , where there are four meaning-planes, formed by taking three of the four words. Running this overnight
                and checking results then.
                </p>
                <p>(7.15.2022) Presented on tSNE language maps and then got some interviews done. <br><br>
                    Two delicious coincidences I've noticed recently.
                    <br><br>The first one is the phrase "sign down". There are so many associated meanings (sign up,
                    write down, sign in, write up) that you'd expect this phrase to suggest <i>something</i>, and yet it
                    is a barren wasteland. Maybe "sign down (here, below)", but why not just "sign (here, below)"?
                    <br><br> The second is that there are two major philosophies based on spoons that nicely complement
                    one another. The first is "spoon theory", or only having a certain number of spoons in a drawer
                    (representing mental energy), and the second is The Matrix's "there is no spoon", which is a
                    post-scarcity declaration of anything being possible. Both make sense; taken together, it is
                    actually a○n expression of the content/form distinction.

                </p>
                <p>(7.14.2022) Paired on clusters for tSNE maps of word2vec... got some clusters with k-means, then
                    changed to DBSCAN which works surprisingly well, and the sklearn implementation makes it easy to
                    assign words to clusters. The way DBSCAN works is that it looks for cluster cores, which at the
                    current settings are two points (words) that are with a distance of 0.3 and with at least 1 neighbor
                    (this is good for isolating extremely close vector pairs, like &quot;map&quot; and
                    &quot;maps&quot;). Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/images/dbscan.png">bigger version

                <p>(7.14.2022) Finished <i>Red Mars</i> and short stories, made some progress on the rest. Today
                    reentering the pairing pool, otherwise revising website.</p>
                <p>(7.11.2022) At home, working intermittently on various things. Reading a book on the topography of
                    seattle, a collection of japanese short stories, man is the measure, the Dawn of Everything, red
                    mars, and a little bit of graph theory.</p>
                <p>(7.6.2022) Spent the day walking around portland. I wanted to cross the border but it is not
                    accessible to pedestrians. Did cross St. John's and Fremont bridges. Yesterday went to Powell's and
                    read a bunch of picture books, and attended long NORC call from pioneer square.
                <p>(7.3.2022) Minecraft is so fun </p>
                <p>(6.30.2022) Went to some chats with new Recursers, and readying a fun presentation for tomorrow on

                    experimenting with d3 as a tool for making slideshows. NORC is moving me from Amerispeak to GSS,
                    which is awesome. </p>
                <p>(6.29.2022) Learned some APL, worked on socketio & eventlet, modernized JS on golf.</p>
                <p>(6.28.2022)
                    (today, yesterday) updated word.golf to use XML http requests between prompts, creating a seamless
                    no-reload experience. The backend code at this point looks terrifying, and there is a display bug
                    where the first word isn't recorded, but it is a significant improvement for the UX :) I also shut
                    down the MySQL database and any queries to it, in preparation for moving to another platform. I will
                    have to do a lot more work to improve the code.
                    <br><br>(weekend, last week) Finished <a href="https://www.eric-xia.com/imagenet2">Tapestry #2</a>,
                    a 50x51 grid of ImageNet averages sorted by semantic similarity. In general these images look pretty
                    muddled, but there's a painterly quality to it that I really like. Will continue to experiment with
                    this.

                    <br><br> Started learning Pixi.js, the library that tetr.io is built off of, and APL. <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xAKttWgP4">Watch this video</a>. Symbols are so cool.

                <p>(6.24.2022) I can't shake the feeling that my site is actively hostile to thoughtful blog pieces now.
                    Anyways, I should probably go work on golf or something. I've been averaging images from Imagenet
                    with the squared root mean method and am about 1/3 of the way done, and basically procrastinating
                    otherwise. Dataclasses are cool, __name__ == __main__ for runnable scripts, multiprocessing, os,
                    numpy is really fast, and logging, timeit, dict and set comprehension. AHDNLNDLSVD </p>
                <p>(6.15.2022) Had a lot of fun this morning setting up an imagenet tapestry at <a
                        href="https://www.eric-xia.com/imagenet">https://www.eric-xia.com/imagenet</a> .The process for
                    making these grids has become very streamlined. First you choose a lump of clay (a base set of word
                    embeddings, 40-50k words) and then you carve away the words you don't need (imagenet's categories
                    share around 2,500 words with word2vec, for the most part nouns: "ball", "sailboat", "pliers",
                    "raccoon") you smooth it out with tSNE by going from 200 dimensions to 2, and then you shape it into
                    a square grid (50x50)! Finally for this project I just took the first image from each category
                    folder and displayed it, forming a mosaic. Originally I was just hosting the 2500ish images from
                    github pages/netlify, but then I decided to use Amazon s3, which works better. I'm very satisfied
                    with the result, and particularly like the yellow and blue diagonals where agricultural and nautical
                    terms border one another. I might be able to do PIL preprocessing which can look for images only
                    with white backgrounds or without them.

                    Yesterday and today, I also worked on a cursor tracker in javascript similar to cursors.io or <a
                        href="http://donottouch.org/">http://donottouch.org/</a>. Reading <i>Man is the Measure</i> by
                    Abel.</p>
                <p> (6.8.2022) Read <i>Against Interpretation</i>, some notebooks from Susan Sontag, stories from <i>The
                        Best American Sports Writing 2019</i>, Chuck Palahnuik's advice memoir, and took home <i>Uncanny
                        Valley</i> and a book about the medical device industry. </p>
                <p>(6.7.2022) days 16 + 17. Started the morning not doing anything in particular except completing a
                    training from NORC and some paperwork. Then I started looking at three.js examples and getting
                    lectured by <a
                        href="https://threejs.org/manual/#en/prerequisites">https://threejs.org/manual/#en/prerequisites</a>
                    which is written by someone with very strong opinions about javascript. Then I spent the afternoon
                    pairing on my old website, conceding a 1-&gt;2 approach instead of 0-&gt;1 (super helpful as a
                    driver even without knowing anything about three! I aspire to have swiss army knife debugging skills
                    as well someday!) and watching code Game of Life! In Rust + WASM! While fire alarms were going of!
                    Anyways, I can&#39;t find motivation to learn Rust, cause although it looks elegant it doesn&#39;t
                    seem like it does anything cool. Today is the 8th which is a wednesday, which means it&#39;s library
                    day (the upper levels only open on wednesday)! Will head to the library and code and read after
                    call.</p>

                <p>(6.6.2022) Day 15. This morning I had a coffee chat with who showed off some really cool demos and
                    convinced me to go to the audio processing showcase. I&#39;m unzipping ImageNet still (15 hours
                    remaining as of right now), but I was actually productive in the meanwhile. I hosted a github pages
                    site with no snowballing problems with Vercel, hosted it on the site <a
                        href="https://www.synplifier.com/">synplifier.com</a>, and stripped the react app from like two
                    years ago down. Then I got a prototype kind of working, and during a pairing session, I had a series
                    of major revelations about how react and npm work that will definitely at least double my javascript
                    productivity from now on. Thank you so much for your patience and help! </p>
                <p>After the call, I went to the showcase which was really interesting, I really liked SunVox and
                    SuperCollider, and realized that the noisecraft app is just scratching the surface when it comes to
                    audio. I think it&#39;s actually built entirely on the Web Audio API, which is super cool....</p>
                <p>Anyways, after that I did about three hours of relearning synthetic biology terms and concepts, and
                    glossed about 50 terms into my dictionary. Even though the DIY biology movement is very dormant
                    right now, I feel really good about synplifier&#39;s use case. There are no friendly dictionaries
                    for making things with biology. It is either theoretical easy stuff from AP Bio, or intensive
                    graduate level research projects. Even without a lot of lab experience, I think I can provide much
                    more intuitive explanations than others can.</p>
                <p>Plan for the rest of the day is to stop using my computer, maybe go outside or for a run. But I&#39;m
                    super excited and optimistic today.</p>
                <p>

                    (6.3.2022) Day 14! Today I woke up late and did some urban hiking. I a book of financial advice from
                    a little free library while walking around. It's still raining heavily, so I'm probably going to go
                    to a bookstore and just spend some time browsing. I did some light es6 exploration, but also looked
                    at svelte which is actually really cool. ImageNet did download so I will play around with it later
                    tonight, otherwise just attended presentations.
                </p>

                <p>(6.2.2022) Day 13. I always plan these posts as an exercise in efficiency, but inevitably go back and
                    edit. Oh well. In the early morning, I poked around on noisecraft some more and made this <a
                        href="https://noisecraft.app/620">squarish tune</a>. I then started experimenting with different
                    AWS services, trying out the OCR service, chatbot service, and S3. I concluded that the best way to
                    use my credits were probably a server for images, or maybe learning how to make an API. I renewed
                    the synplifier.com domain name on Namecheap. I started downloading ImageNet (261 gb) for an
                    archetypal navigator interface built on word vectors (I just took a look at it and realized it
                    failed :(). Finally, I read a bunch of excerpts from NLP papers, some from the LUNAR lab at Brown,
                    and it served to reinforce my impression of the field as one where essentially no progress has been
                    made towards grounded understanding, except for where the gradual massive accumulation of internet
                    data in Common Crawl+ has allowed for the construction of a few beautiful artifacts (word embeddings
                    and models), like silt coalescing into a pearl. </p>
                <p>I then ended up having a coffee chat , where we discussed future plans and web development. This was
                    all very interesting. I decided to learn javascript modules, so I could learn three.js, so I could
                    visualize terrain and heightmaps. I then paired, where we spent an hour tackling a single tricky bug
                    in his React knowledge guide, where a context was out of sync. I&#39;m very new to JS development,
                    so it was super interesting (well, to watch... probably not to code), although I wish I could have
                    contributed more to the debugging process. Then I went to the creative coding workshop, ported a
                    recursive voronoi sketch that seems appropriate to name bloodcore(<a
                        href="https://editor.p5js.org/rkique/sketches/Ev9aMTgLq">https://editor.p5js.org/rkique/sketches/Ev9aMTgLq</a>)
                    , and started reading more about Hoff&#39;s algorithm and the trick employed for making it
                    performant. Voronoi is such an interesting concept! I don&#39;t really understand it yet though.
                    Then I left for the gym, and I just came back. I&#39;ll probably go back out again after eating
                    dinner to sit somewhere in the international district and read, or some other form of productive
                    procrastination.</p>

                <p>(6.1.2022) Day 12 of Recurse! Today was an incredibly fun day. I spent most of it learning how to use
                    the Noisecraft node editor, attempting making electronic &quot;music&quot;. I am completely new to
                    audio processing and found all of it very interesting, if a little overwhelming. I found myself
                    reflecting on the process of visual programming, especially with an established community, and
                    common strategies that can be employed. I found myself conceptualizing these strategies as
                    getting a minimum working example,
                    forking existing projects and tweaking one thing,
                    picking one piece to understand at a time,
                    extending examples,
                    combining examples,
                <p>Enjoy my pieces from today:</p>
                <ul>
                    &quot;getting bludgeoned repeatedly on broken glass&quot; <a
                        href="https://noisecraft.app/612">https://noisecraft.app/612</a> ,
                    &quot;liquified plastic horse&quot; <a
                        href="https://noisecraft.app/614">https://noisecraft.app/614</a>,

                </ul>
                I also paired on word golf, adding streaks and discussing potential shareability and difficulty metrics
                that I could use. I&#39;m still wondering if there are more useful applications lying just beneath the
                surface... in the evening I was feeling cooped up so ran 11 miles to bellevue.</p>

                <p>(5.31.2022) Day 11 of Recurse! I think. I didn&#39;t code on Monday but I did quickly modify a DIY
                    projection to play with here (<a
                        href="https://www.eric-xia.com/projections.html">https://www.eric-xia.com/projections.html</a>)
                    at some point. Today I was very productive but not for very long, pairing with Cody to make my first
                    original interactive Observable, a <a
                        href="https://observablehq.com/@759c6b835359aafe/us-household-income-by-region">visualization of
                        household income by region</a> from the Census 2020 data. I think I understand banding,
                    Observable, and Javascript better now, even with the hacky solution we came up with. I also played
                    around with maps, read a cookbook (Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat), edited Wikipedia, and attended the Wacky
                    Ideas Production Group, where I found this <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm8JRlJ1q50">gem</a>. I have so many ideas for what to
                    work on next! A watershed map from USGS data, maybe. Or experimenting with Voronoi.</p>

                <p>
                    (5.26.2022) Day 9 of Recurse. I learned about Joins and Selections in d3 and spent way too long
                    working on a p5 sketch as usual. I found a few ways to introduce visual complexity that work well
                    together: perlin noise gradients, stepped lines, and overlaying groups of lines to produce a moire
                    effect. Then I paired on an adversarial 2048 project in Rust, which was fascinating. I thought it
                    was interesting how simple minimax is as an algorithm (well, in theory): if you can reduce a game to
                    a single score, it doesn't matter how complicated the rules are, it's just another version of
                    tug-of-war.
                </p>
                <p>(5.25.2022) Day 8! I didn&#39;t feel especially productive today, but looking back I think I learned
                    a lot. Mainly some technical issues prevented me from connecting on Zoom, so could not pair. I read
                    the first two sections of <i>Python One-Liners</i>. Learned about using map and lambda as an
                    alternative to list comprehension, slicing, zip, combining np.nonzero and booleans to query arrays,
                    and multi-dimension numpy arrays. Then I generated a second static grid from the older glove
                    embedding, with more words but less curated. Here&#39;s a <a
                        href="https://www.eric-xia.com/static_grid.html">link to the first one</a>. Then I started
                    reading <i>The Map that changed the World</i>, which is about the foundation of modern geology by
                    the self-educated surveyor <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_(geologist">William
                        Smith</a>)); it&#39;s a <i>really</i> fascinating story.
                    <br><br>
                    Specifically, it made me think about what constitutes a frontier in the public imagination.
                    Frederick Jackson Turner wrote the &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot;
                    in 1893. The west coast, Alaska, outer space, and the deep ocean have at various points in time been
                    considered as the final frontier. What&#39;s so interesting to me is that even for William Smith,
                    <i>in the 1700s</i>, geological history was not a pure frontier, in the sense of exploring new lands
                    in other places; it was instead a reexamination, of the rock stratification around coal pits, of
                    details dismissed by others to be uninteresting. By doing so, and realizing that the present is the
                    key to the past, he was able to discover a vast amount of richness in earth and earth history. In
                    the past, the church prevented these kinds of inquiry from taking place. The idea of fossils were
                    viewed as heretical; everything was either already discovered, or divine will. And while it might
                    feel like a lot has changed, I really think this idea of &quot;everything interesting has already
                    been discovered, or requires massive amounts of funding, or will be found by large international
                    consortiums of scientists&quot; is especially prevalent, at least among people in my generation. But
                    I disagree, and stories like these encourage me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (5.24.2022) Day 7! Today was the first day I went into the field in addition to attending Recurse.
                    After the pairing session I went to attempt interviews. I did not coordinate very well, but I was
                    able to touch quite a few cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (5.23.2022) Day 6! Super productive and learning things. Made my first original graphs with d3 of
                    github commit histories, and then wrangled the grid textfiles into a walkable prototype. Did not
                    code after 2pm. No meetings. Will try to stick to the same routine tomorrow.

                    (5.22.2022) 20 miles to auburn and stumbled into a horse racecourse at Emerald Downs. The Interurban
                    from Renton to Auburn are some of the most beautiful officepark aesthetics I've seen. Going to start
                    reading an anthology of japanese short stories! Trying to stay off my computer during the weekend.
                </p>

                    (5.20.2022)
                    Day 5! Today I worked mostly on word golf and ended up pairing on it. While I ended up getting a
                    working prototype for four neighbor golf, because of the lack of an actual grid pretty much every
                    word was circular. Just using the four closest neighbors definitely doesn't work. However, in the
                    afternoon we rebounded and got a real legitimate grid (we had tSNE coordinates all of this time so
                    I'm not sure why it didn't occur to me... lol). Excited to test this out soon. I also presented and
                    watched some cool presentations, and learned about kernels and Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (5.19.2022)
                    PS: Sort of done with <i>The Shenzhen Experiment</i>. So much of it seems utterly unreal to me.
                    Being sent into the countryside as a teenager of the urban youth, building a floor of a skyscraper
                    every three days, temples to sea gods, nail houses and peasant apartments, village industries, the
                    collision of cooperative and competitive motives, idealism in utter poverty, boarding a ship to
                    America and going to Ecuador instead... it still resonates powerfully, more my ancestral story than
                    anything else.
                    <br><br>
                    Day 4! Today I mostly did d3 throughout the morning, attended the meet & greet call, and then ended
                    up going on a reading binge of killedbyapixel's blog, a game dev and generative artist who produces
                    extremely intricate artwork from 140 characters or less of javascript. I also attended the creative
                    coding call, where I stumbled upon an interesting concept while making a <a
                        href="https://editor.p5js.org/rkique/sketches/0qKYaRWHw">simple symmetric draw tool</a> in p5.
                    Because you have X and Y symmetries, each quadrant of the page actually makes up a *separate form of
                    interaction* with the entire picture. In effect you can draw four different ways. For example, with
                    the original exponential scale of mouseX and mouseY to the HSL color system, drawing in the upper
                    quadrants is negative space (black) or ambient blue and green. Drawing in the left bottom quadrant
                    is white, grey, and yellow organic shapes; and the right bottom quadrant contains a rainbow of
                    different hues. It's really fun to play with and so I spent hours just clicking and dragging. Then I
                    remembered I had a pairing call and ended rescheduling it for tomorrow. Haha. Several calls
                    tomorrow; will probably return to working on golf then.

                    (5.18.2022)
                    Day 3. Purposefully making this short to loosen future constraints. Today was not a productive day
                    in terms of lines of code written; it was, on the other hand, supremely creatively inspiring.
                    Tackled d3.js, read about Union Find, got linked to a bunch of geography and software blogs (Joe
                    Morrison is an instant favorite):

                <blockquote>If you work at the intersection of maps and software, at some point in your life you’ve
                    probably heard yourself muttering some version of the following analogy to a stubbornly confused
                    family member: "You know Google Maps? What I do is, like, build little pieces of Google Maps over
                    and over for people who need them but can’t just use Google Maps because they’re not allowed to for
                    some reason, or another."</blockquote>

                I spent a good deal of my afternoon reading about deck.gl, satellite startups, OSM, Google Maps, climate
                change and change detection, Leaflet and Mapbox... all while half-listening to people talk about careers
                in the background (My theory is that this is what I've been missing! My most engaged times reading blogs
                last year were all during online classes where the pleasant background noise of teachers made me yearn
                for intellectual excitement!) As often happens with rabbit holes, I found myself inexorably drawn to the
                MIT Media Lab, this time through the Senseable city lab, finding ascii webcams, isochronic maps, space
                bubbles, and the theory of the pointiest path... yeah anyways so much to do. So little time. Must not
                write so much or so carefully from now on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    (5.17.2022)
                    Finally winding down for my second day, after around 10 hours. In the early morning, I chose to read
                    my d3.js book, learning about loading with d3.csv() and d3.json(), and saw how you could create bins
                    and scale data. I was alarmed that there wasn't any kind of note about the ease of
                    misrepresentation: something like this is presented as one of the examples:
                    <br>
                <pre>
d3.scaleLinear().domain([2000, 10000]).range([0, 500])
</pre>

                <br>

                When you create visualizations without including zero as a frame of reference, it's very easy to
                misrepresent the truth! This is data literacy 101! Of course, there are definitely some applications
                where you need to do otherwise, but I'm still really surprised.
                I did this instead of going to the check-in call; I prefer writing these checkins (checkouts?) out more
                than a conversational format. Plus, text is easy to share on my blog as well!
                <br><br>
                After that, I paired on Game of Life! Using p5.js, we got kind of far; not only did we make a grid, we
                were even able to add six squares for an oscillator! Then we suffered what I assume is called technical
                debt and did not get to implementing any of the rules. I left to do l33tcode problems, but got
                distracted by the *amazing* text animations on https://musicforprogramming.net/ and only got the easy
                problem done. As kitschy or cute as text animations might sound (the shapes of these letters on my
                screen are so arbitrary! Why restrict yourself to them!), I find they portray the absurdity of language
                well, what is almost a sense of fear that the shapes will stay as meaningless squiggles until the relief
                of discerning meaning.
                <br><br>
                Then I had a call with the creator of the aforementioned word game, learned a lot, and got very
                motivated to work through the afternoon. I threw myself into an actually challenging problem related to
                making a standardized grid: given four neighboring points in space, how do you assign them directions?
                It's easy for a human but difficult (for me) to code in. There's trigonometry involved, and choosing
                between rotating clockwise or ccw. I wonder if I'm missing a really simple approach actually.
                <br><br>
                Here's a sample of that very messy code:
                <pre>
#clockwise swing
def swing(indice):
    return abs(np.arctan(Xdiffs[indice]/Ydiffs[indice])) 
while len(quadrants) != len(set(quadrants)):
    for i in range(0, 4):
        if quadrants.count(quadrants[i]) > 1:
            #while more than one in same quadrants, move the closer one (indice wrt quadrants & diffs)
            indices = [index for index, element in enumerate(quadrants) if element == quadrants[i]]
            swings = [swing(indice) for indice in indices]
            minSwingIndex = indices[swings.index(min(swings))]
            quadrants[minSwingIndex]+=1
            #print(f"point with indice {minSwingIndex} moved from {quadrants[minSwingIndex]} to {quadrants[minSwingIndex]+1}")
            if(quadrants[minSwingIndex]) > 4:
                quadrants[minSwingIndex] = 1
            </pre>
                <br><br>
                I ended up successfully sorting four closest neighbors for each word into directions, but not isomorphic
                to a grid. While this was somewhat disappointing, visualizing a random walk of neighborhoods made me
                happy. I was able to build a utility tool to view undirected graphs very quickly, gutting my graph view
                and simplifying a lot of it (you can use it too! go to https://www.eric-xia.com/graphviz.html). It's
                built on force-graph.js.

                Finally, I uploaded my progress on research to my blog.
                All in all, I'm super happy with my work again. Tomorrow, I hope to be as productive as I was today and
                continue tackling hard problems!

                </p>
                <p>(5.16.2022)
                    PS: Breakcore and golfing go so well together. Youtube playlists <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoJ_VTA4PhY">ex</a> are amazing... feeling like there's a
                    real positive impact to the sport. When word choice becomes unconscious activity, people no longer
                    have to reach for words. Expressing yourself becomes natural.
                    <br><br>
                    RECURSE DAY #1 <br><br>
                    I had a great first day! I adopted a parrot, walked around the park and took some selfies, and tried
                    out the maze in the top right corner. I also met a bunch of super interesting people, and found out
                    a certain popular semantic game I had been referred to many times was made by a Recurser! Finally I
                    attended the Clojure Conclave, which was a meditative experience learning about things like
                    generative testing and garbage collection.
                    <br><br>
                    All of the good energy also translated into a very productive session iterating on golf, where I
                    started spring cleaning by removing large swathes of obselete functionality (including the user
                    authentication page, links to view pages, and profile) and replaced it with a simple plotlyjs graph
                    working with LocalStorage. I also generated and sifted through around two hundred additional prompts
                    for temporary use (but plan to trade out daily 9 or 18 prompt courses in the future). For the first
                    time in a while, I feel proud of golf again!
                    <br><br>
                    While this first day went really well, I was totally in my comfort zone. I need and want to engage
                    in more hard problems and exploration. Tomorrow, I'll try to join in on the daily leetcode problems
                    which I have no experience in, do my first pairing session, and actively learn from a hardcover copy
                    of "D3.js in action" I checked out from the library. Thinking of diving into the GIS section and
                    trying to build a simple geographical visualization for Amerispeak, the NORC project I'm a field
                    interviewer for.
                </p>
                <p>(5.15.2022) Recurse begins tomorrow! Exciting! I was hoping to begin interviewing this weekend but I
                    haven't got my badge yet. I really hope it gets here soon...</p>
                <p>(5.11.2022) Today was the second training call for NORC and I caught up on Recurse emails. I finally
                    got some work done fixing word.golf and making it look presentable for now. I'm pretty tired so
                    going home now, but excited for the coming weeks.</p>
                <p>(5.2.2022) God two jump precalculated word golf is so amazing and the prompts are so good </p>
                <p>(4.28.2022) Did some of the work. Need to script a short animation for initial display...<br><br>Read
                    <i>The Complacent Class</i>, started a book about Shenzhen. I'm working on increasing engagement
                    through 1. adding a certain number of weekly prompts and 2. different difficulties by distance. Also
                    finally switched 100 glove out for a 200 neighbor word2vec model. I really like the direction this
                    is going but there's a ton of front-end work before I can finalize it.
                </p>
                <p>(4.24.2022) Ran 31 miles to Tacoma yesterday, passing by the Georgetown neighborhood, the King County
                    international and SeaTac airports, Kent, and Federal Way. I was thinking about the aesthetics of the
                    metropolitan area south of Seattle vs north. They are similar at first glance, but the south side
                    feels more rooted in history, with older and more interesting public art. For example, around the
                    Rainer Beach brewery there are a bunch of poles by the railroad striped green and black, and
                    tapering into a nasty looking spike. I was reminded of nuclear waste warnings, but they're
                    apparently supposed to be artwork, representing trees. It's the same with the malls, the logos and
                    advertisments are generally wackier and older looking than the Alderwood area.
                    <br><br>I added a self-portrait around the About Me section, and also started writing about word
                    golf under golfing.html. Started reading <i>Superstructures</i>, read <i>Shopping Mall</i>, and
                    <i>The Beggar</i> by Reinhard Sorge from an anthology of German Expressionist plays, which is very
                    interesting. I've been working on some drawings but none that I want to put up at the moment. The
                    current site structure is temporary, I will definitely be expanding downwards...
                </p>
                <p> (4.19.2022) <a href="symbolistics.html">Some word2vec associations of greek letters.</a> I want to
                    publish projects somewhere! This site is definitely suffering from growing pains.</p>
                <p> (4.19.2022) Realized I've become way too pessimistic about technology. </p>
                <p> (4.17.2022) Spent today drawing movie of stills and relearning blender. Tomorrow I'll be working on
                    word golf; the infrastructure is in a good place, I just have to finally get around to designing six
                    prompts for an inital challenge. They just have to be good; they don't have to be perfect. I find it
                    much easier to start sketching with a ballpoint pen on notebook than on nice paper, but once I build
                    up enough confidence I'll end up switching. </p>
                <p> (4.15.2022) Hit 7 miles at 6:30 pace yesterday to Othello of which I am quite proud. Ended up
                    wandering around Renton and getting on three separate buses by accident. </p>
                <p>
                    (4.13.2022) Read <i>1517</i> by Peter Marshall which argues the Reformation was invented, making my
                    way through the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and <i>Ecotopia</i>. The Canterbury Tales, at least the
                    first story about Arcita and Palamon, are absolutely enthralling. I walked five miles from Lake City
                    to UDistrict while reading it. Something about the verse that leaves a mark in you... especially out
                    as the sun sets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (4.10.2022) I discovered the Central Seattle Public Library! It's an amazing place. Read
                    <i>Norwegian Wood</i> by Murakami, <i>Black Dogs</i> by Ian McEwan, a book on wildfowl decoys, a
                    Hegel primer, <i>100 Years of Solitude</i> (don't bother), a book about tarot cards, and <i>Aquinas
                        on Virtue</i>, started reading <i>Magic Mountain</i> and <i>Analects</i>, almost done with
                    <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> by Murakami. Oh also, <i>Ecotopia</i> which is a WILD sci-fi novel about a
                    Pacific Northwest breakaway country set in 1999 (which, while published in 1970, covers a lot of the
                    same ideas that are hot right now around urban design and walkable cities...). I'll write a nice
                    long review when I finish: what has changed since the 1970s about American cities? And what has
                    changed about our desires to improve them? Our ambitions?
                    <br><br>
                    Something I've re-noticed recently is just how important word choice is when making distinctions
                    about abstract concepts. Religion for example: what does believing in a "higher power" mean? What do
                    you associate with a word like "divine", "providence"? "consequentialist"? "form"? "formal"?
                    "cause"? Language is different from math; this reminds me of the article I read a while back about
                    how people experience things differently. For some, when they close their eyes they can literally
                    see all sorts of squiggly shapes moving about, and others just see nothing, and as a result they are
                    not talking about the same nothingness.

                    (3.30.2022) It's 1pm and there are still six hours of daylight left! This is amazing. Halfway
                    through <i>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i> and <i>Economics for the Public Good</i>. Reviewed math
                    this morning. I realized a couple days ago that I didn't have a .dockerignore, specifically
                    forgetting to ignore .git, which meant that my container sizes had been 2 or 3 gigabytes too large
                    all along! Now my deploy times are six times faster. And yesterday I removed 210 gb of old
                    containers from docker desktop.

                <p>

                    (3.28.2022) Feeling good. Read <i>The Glass Castle</i> and <i>Starting with No</i>, working my way
                    through <i>Economics for the Public Good</i>, <i>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i> and of course <i>Div
                        Grad Curl</i>. Slowly but steadily improving my understanding of matrices and linear
                    transformations.

                <p>
                    (3.25.2022) I finished reading <i>The Soul of the New Machine</i> and beginning <i>Economics for the
                        Public Good</i> in depth. I've recently been watching some fascinating videos, including Adult
                    Swim's Infomercials, the beautiful surreal <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_V-VJQT6pM">Interface</a>, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>, and the
                    first seven episodes of <i>Servant of the People</i>, the TV series starring the current Ukrainian
                    president. This show is deeper than most would expect. Right off the bat, the
                    history-teacher-turned-president is confronted with accusations of populism and "putting a show on
                    for the people". The whole show is about changing those deeply rooted beliefs.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm behind my goal of 200 books this year, but way ahead of where I'd be otherwise. Things I've been
                    thinking about recently: young people, as a general rule, are much smarter than most intellectuals*
                    think, and they have way more time to worry about themselves than you do. They also don't waste our
                    lives doing things that don't matter to them. <br><br>

                    Along these lines, a good chunk of Twitter seems to be supportive of returning to the small web or
                    reinventing the creator economy, in theory, but both exist already and are thriving in Neocities,
                    the Yesterweb and Patreon; it's a cultural dissonance, and a reluctance to give up a talking point,
                    that prevent this recognition.
                    <br><br>
                    This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes, which encapsulates many things I both worry about and
                    love about technology. It's from an essay by Jill Lepore -- <i>The Last Time Democracy Almost
                        Died</i>: "Don't ask whether you need an umbrella. Go outside and stop the rain". What I worry
                    about now is the Effective Altruism poster I saw the other day. I worry about people, believing
                    themselves to be optimizing agents, spending all their time thinking about agency, grantmaking,
                    quantifying the possibilities inherent in people, how to extract that possibility. I worry about the
                    whole exercise becoming turned out like any other activity on a college resume. Is it not beneficial
                    in the long run though, people giving more to institutions that can do better? I don't believe the
                    differences matter. It feels removed from reality, the same way productivity and lifestyle coaches
                    are, and too ghost-like for me. But -- I will resolve not to worry about it, or think about it,
                    because that's the advice I'm giving. I want to make synthesizer music now. I want to draw
                    animations in a gritty, surreal style. I want to practice lockpicking, get really good at vector
                    calc, and become fluent in Chinese. I want to work with isolates and skeletons and more
                    contemporary, faster language models.
                    <br><br>
                    Another quote from 1979 SF<i>The Missing Man</i>: "I mean, we don't know what happened in the past
                    exactly. It's gone anyhow. It's not real anymore. So we can say anything happened we want to have
                    happened. If one past is going to make trouble, we can change it, just by being dumb, and everything
                    will straighten out. Like, for example, we just met, right now. Nothing else happened".
                    <br><br>
                    I don't have a real point for all this, but utlimately it comes down to saying: I feel like changing
                    the future needs you to have a certain state of suspended belief in your mind, a genuine state of
                    curiosity, that the environment and tech climate, feels unconducive towards. It doesn't feel
                    creative enough in the ways that matter. I sound like a broken record. It's the same thing I was
                    trying to get at in my other essays. Sigh. Love your work, people. At least I love my work!

                    ADVENTURES IN IPHONE SE REPAIR
                    <br> <br>
                    1. broke screen while doing stair flights on the 15th <br> <br>
                    2. had glitch effect until wednesday when unresponsive, could still use airpods and apple pay. <br>
                    <br>

                    3. Order screen online to fix.<br> <br>


                    4. First fix a disaster. Try unscrewing plates and disconnect/reconnecting four times, still dead
                    screen. Can still charge phone up until this point. Lose about half of screws, strip most of rest,
                    damage black coating on back cover, rip the front sensor flex cable entirely. rip the home button
                    cable halfway while trying to replace it. Up until 2 am before giving up. Convinced I broke the
                    camera cable.<br> <br>

                    5. Next day, surrounded by entrails of phone, review the original repair video many times. Learn
                    more about iphone SE schematic by watching teardown videos. Read online forums. Browse
                    /r/mobilerepair. Develop various techniques, such as pressing spudger against back of plate to
                    provide leverage while unscrewing. Figure out what kind of screws (1.3 and 2.8mm Phillips Y000) and
                    which screwdriver of the three provided actually works. Getting better understanding but still not
                    any kind of progress.<br> <br>

                    6. At home for weekend, discuss giving up and buying new phone. Although feeling like inputs and
                    outputs ruined, refuse to give up on processor and battery. Determine provided screen was defective.
                    Get replacement screen from amazon free of charge.<br> <br>

                    7. Second fix today. Try to attach new screen to iphone. Replace only two main flex cables with few
                    screws left. Phone dead, charging on old cable on wall socket. No response. Wish I had ammeter.
                    Wonder again if internal damage. With no other options I plug into computer again to see if anything
                    happens. To surprise, connect sound does. Nothing connected though. Look at phone.<br> <br>

                    8. A light by SIM card tray is on! The apple logo shows up but immediately dies on move. Retracing
                    steps, track down critical point. Determine there are four small coils on the top sensor assembly
                    bracket, which when touched immediately shutdown. Problem is I have no more suitable screws for the
                    top sensor. Remember seeing reddit post making fun of mall kiosk repairs with shipping tape. Repair
                    using strip of shipping tape. But cut out hole so it cannot melt.<br> <br>

                    9. Apple logo always loads and phone is reassembled! Screen loads to say "phone unavailable". Power
                    off and reset, managing to get an erase phone option, unfortunately asking to press home button to
                    start reset. Turn off and on again until message is replaced with language selection menu. Begin
                    normal setup. Realize that I didn't actually rip the camera cable and main camera still works fine!
                    Can purchase new home button and front camera.<br> <br>

                    Total cost: $30!

                <p>(3.18.2022) <a href="food.html">How to be a vegetarian</a>. Okay. Just spent the day working on word
                    golf. Plan for rest of day is to go to gym, consume perishable items at home, and then replace my
                    phone screen. I've been reading snippets of <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>, <i>30-second physics</i>,
                    <i>div grad curl</i>, and some math online. In general I'm happy with my understanding. I will keep

                <p>(3.7.2022) Just finished writing a long email and about to go to bed. 30 miles yesterday from
                    Bremerton to Kingston. Thinking about word.golf again. I think the promise of it is like this:
                    If there is a single sport that can claim being a sport of the mind, it would be something very
                    similar to word golf. The basic concept is, unambiguously, trains of thought. There are two
                    shortcomings that are very difficult to overcome. Why should the grid be oriented towards the
                    target? Is it possible to standardize orderings, and if not, how do we provide a foundation for
                    strategy? These two problems might provide solutions to one another. A cooccurence wordspace,
                    trained on contemporary texts, with curated words and no filtering. Each word will provide exactly
                    the same neighbors each time, in the same order. It's more natural. It could be harder at first. But
                    then it would get easier.

                    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4584800712">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
                    I read this in a thrift store, skipping sections near the end about sports, race, and gender as the
                    text I read from is 1979.<br /><br />There's an abundance of fascinating analysis in this collection
                    as well as some historiographical points of interest. At this time there were two major trends when
                    it came to sociology: the functionalist and conflict theory schools of thought. The book compares
                    the role of sports in society from these two perspectives. From a functionalist point of view,
                    sports serves as a microcosm of society and aids in its proper functioning. It is primarily an
                    inspirational force for good which leads to the continued functioning of society, providing benefits
                    social, moral, spiritual, and of course physical. From a conflict school of thought, sports is
                    viewed as an opiate. The existence of sports is a progressive, fordist installation meant to subdue
                    the spirit of the working class. The existence of sports transforms the pure joy of unstructured
                    play into "prisons of measured time" (I really, really like that quote). In general though I agree
                    with the functionalist point of view here.<br /><br />There are two essays in this collection which
                    stand out not for their subject matter but for their stunning lack of rigor. One is an
                    analysis-comparison of drive drain (the hobbesian notion that violent sports serves as an outlet for
                    a baseline of violent impulse) and cultural pattern theories (the more modern belief that violence
                    is transmitted purely culturally and that using sports as a hedge against war will always backfire).
                    The author endorses the cultural pattern theory -- on the basis of "ten randomly selected violent
                    and nonviolent civilizations throughout history" and a smattering of meaningless data. He then
                    proceeds to lecture the audience on p-value and correlation (lol). Garbage in garbage out. Another
                    is at the end of the book, by a feminist author who loves to write what is ostensibly academic
                    jargon in capital letters and also use the word "gynergy" a lot. And call sports
                    "MenSport/OldSport/UrSport".<br /><br />But on the whole this is a remarkable collection of essays,
                    much better quality than I expected and very interesting. One essay is about the capacity of
                    football to cause harm, and notes that NINETEEN players died in the 1905 professional football
                    season. With the well-intended proliferation of hardshell helmets this issue has only gotten more
                    controversial, as the durability of these helmets made them, ironically, an essential *weapon* for
                    players, allowing them to ram others headfirst. <br /><br />Other essays here focus on participation
                    in sports among youth. I can definitely see, in the form of a reaction to a reaction, where this
                    whole idea of "America gives out too many participation trophies" comes from. Because it's clear
                    that America in the 1970s was INTENSELY focused on winning within sports, and correspondingly about
                    success in business. All of those quotes "when the going gets tough, the tough get going" which seem
                    incredibly outdated today were very commonplace. There's one statistic about Watergate: 60% of of
                    interviewed junior managers said they would cover up for their superiors if in the same position. So
                    all of the participation trophies, the trend away from relentless winning to a stance that
                    prioritized intrinsic joy, were created by a collective realization of parents in the 1970s that the
                    culture had become too competitive. And so maybe we're trending another way again
                    today...<br /><br /><br /><br />

                    (2.25.2022) Okay. I'm sculpting the Google News word2vec model. Initial vocab size is three million.
                    First thing is to index against wordfrequency for a zipf score of 1.5 or more (average occurrence of
                    one in 31 million), which immediately reduces size down to 245k. Removing forbidden characters (like
                    # which encodes for any number) reduces to 157k. These are both relatively low-risk operations;
                    forbidden characters does not exclude the single hyphen '-' or the apostrophe, and zipf only
                    excludes words like "srebotnik" or "baronetage". The next trickier step is eliminating first and
                    last name words, which can lead to namehell. Using a standard list of english names will lead to
                    excluding words which have a common usage, e.g. "baker". So instead, we will perform a
                    double-negative operation on the list of names, which uses a free dictionary API to eliminate words
                    with a standard definition. That's where I am right now -- the API limits continuous requests but I
                    can chunk input/output in batches of a thousand or so. Update later.

                    Finished <i>American Psycho</i>, Halfway through <i>Project Hail Mary</i>, started but probably
                    won't finish <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> by Neil Postman. <i>Project Hail Mary</i> has a lot
                    of wishful thinking on the part of the author: <i>"The field of speculative extraterrestrial biology
                        is small—only five hundred or so people in the world. And everyone I talk to—from Oxford
                        professors to Tokyo University researchers—seems to agree that you (middle school science
                        teacher) could have led it if you hadn’t suddenly left!"</i> but it's also pretty exciting, with
                    the same kind of DIY experiments as <i>The Martian</i>. <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i> is
                    interesting from a historiographical perspective -- what are the constant worries of the
                    intellectual class? What are the new ones? Spoiler: there aren't many new ones.

                <p>(2.16.2022) Updates... Reviewing <i>div grad curl</i> and I'm happy with my understanding now, at
                    least for div. There really is an intuition about surface integrals you can build, approximating
                    solids as squares instead of area as slices, and of flux, as alignment at many points. I'm just over
                    halfway done with <i>American Psycho</i>; yesterday I read <i>Redshirts</i> by John Scalzi, which I
                    probably wouldn't recommend. I'm going to write a full review for <i>Pyscho</i> but my initial
                    impressions are really good. It combines the emotionless droll of a didactic perfectionist with
                    sequences of unhinged madness. It is in heavy criticism of what is not quite consumerism but still a
                    failure to engage, present at the highest levels of society. Music, skincare, designer clothing,
                    furniture -- it is all exquisitely described and yet the mentalities of the characters (who fade in
                    and out in a blur) remain primitive.

                    before dinner though. Other than that, making a minor UI fix which will take two hours and doing
                    math. Why does it have to recompile the whole container? Sad.

                    which I found underneath a sculpture in Capitol Hill. Plan for tomorrow: run math morning, design
                    monochrome posters night. Also -- I'm getting better at cooking! </p>
                <p> (2.5.2022) Lots more work today on golf. Redesigned google authentication to use GSI and also styled
                    cytoscape to work with color scheming. Also worked on the mobile layout. Posters are seeming more
                    like a viable option. Super proud of how far I've come. Will spend the rest of the night drawing.

                <p>(2.4.2022) 10 mile run this morning down to Madison Beach.

                    Figured out how to output JSON from the database model and formatted it. Implemented a graph viewer
                    with cytoscape.js fed with JSON. The spacing algorithm is "cose-bilkent". It's basic, so in the
                    future we want to have closest path and start and end words highlighted, better spacing, animated
                    interactive etc. but this version works great for diagnostics. Went through 255 base prompts and
                    identified the ones with the highest entity counts, basically words and links. Around 85 or a third
                    of them have 100 entities or more; these are the top completed and probably most interesting
                    prompts, and we can restrict play to them in the future. Out of those 85 (graphed) I identified 12
                    outliers with 198 entities or more. Analysis of these outlier prompts show that they are
                    heuristically much more interesting than the average prompt: pilot>pineapple, discovery>quilt,
                    mammal>argument, taxi>alphabet, quartz>limit, neon>mechanic. I'm thinking I can do some statistical
                    analysis (what difficulty? what distance? what diversity? what range?) now that we have a good
                    empirical basis (~3000 completed runs) on which to grade prompts, and a convincing metric for a good
                    prompt (Do people complete it?). One interesting note is that for almost all potato>flag runs the
                    player will go to "country" which is not directly connected to flag, but eventually find their way
                    over. I really like the shape of taxi>alphabet and monitor>pupil. catcher>bowl and pipe>license
                    exhibit a lot of loopy behavior. Finally I was surprised by that none of these prompts exhibit
                    bottleneck behavior where the player always goes to a middle word before the finish.

                <p> (2.3.2022) The past few days have been eventful. I'm trying to do math and work on golf, which
                    doesn't leave a lot of time for other priorities like reading. I still want to have time to explore
                    and draw different things though. I might take also protracted break from thinking, because I
                    haven't really enjoyed thinking lately, due to the mess of discourse around tech that doesn't really
                    interest me. One thing I have noticed however is that writing becomes more difficult the longer you
                    put it off for. So maybe it's back to the same habits as before: just with updates here about my
                    daily activities. </p>

                My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4498020452">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
                V. is more historical and surrealist than what I originally imagined. The closest works I've read before
                to V. would be, in terms of subject matter, Hugo by Brian Selznick, and in narrative complexity, Aliens
                and Anorexia by Chris Kraus. In terms of alienation, the concept of electronic automata was already
                fully developed at this time, and it's a big focus in the later chapters. Happily V. is also not a tired
                existential "nothing", a concept which is developed with minor characters but which doesn't affect the
                main plot.<br /><br />While a work like Infinite Jest has a central location of Boston which is then
                zoomed in and out off in a dizzying fashion, V. is more an exploration of two characters across time,
                and their immediate circles in various moments of historical crisis: Suez Canal crisis, Fiume, Malta,
                Cape Town, and going from the early 1960s back to the 1890s. One is Stencil Jr, who is chasing after a
                briefly mentioned figure from his father's notebooks known as V. The other is a Benny Profane, who I
                assume is vaguely autobiographical given that he is part of the Royal Navy and Pynchon served in the US
                Navy.<br /><br />However, Infinite Jest and V. are very similar in terms of the complexity of its minor
                characters, of which there are many -- this kind of irreducible complexity is a mark of modernist
                writing in general. There's really interesting section early on about a depressed Zionist sailor named
                Da Cohno who purchases a machine gun in a salad bar and spends his days assembling and disassembling
                it.<br /><br />In particular I was very surprised by the complexity of the Arab characters in chapter
                three, although I suspect they don't really stand up to much scrutiny historically; he admitted to
                writing that chapter off of Baedecker's travel guide to Egypt. It's much better than DFW's use of
                "experialist" though.<br /><br />Here's what Pynchon has to say about tourism and
                multiculturalism.<br />> This is a  curious country, populated only by a breed called "tourists." Its
                landscape  is one of inanimate monuments and buildings; near-inanimate barmen,  taxi-drivers, bellhops,
                guides: there to do any bidding, to various degrees  of efficiency, on receipt of the recommended
                baksheesh, pourboire, mancia,  tip. More than this it is two-dimensional, as is the Street, as are the 
                pages and maps of those little red handbooks.abundant  flush of water and a supply of proper toilette
                paper"), the tourist may  wander anywhere in this coordinate system without fear. War never becomes 
                more serious than a scuffle with a pickpocket, one of "the huge army . . .  who are quick to recognize
                the stranger and skilful in taking advantage of  his ignorance"; depression and prosperity are reflected
                only in the rate of  exchange; politics are of course never discussed with the native population. 
                Tourism thus is supranational, like the Catholic Church, and perhaps the  most absolute communion we
                know on earth: for be its members American,  German, Italian, whatever, the Tour Eiffel, Pyramids, and
                Campanile all  evoke identical responses from them; their Bible is clearly written and does  not admit
                of private interpretation; they share the same landscapes, suffer  the same inconveniences; live by the
                same pellucid time-scale. They are the  Street's Own.<br /><br />Here's what Pynchon says about
                psuedointellectual culture:<br />> referring to himself as a Catatonic Expressionist and his work as
                "the  ultimate in non-communication." Melvin played the guitar and sang liberal  folk songs. The pattern
                would have been familiar - bohemian, creative,  arty - except that it was even further removed from
                reality, Romanticism in its furthest decadence, being only an exhausted impersonation of poverty,
                 rebellion and artistic "soul." For it was the unhappy fact that most of them  worked for a living and
                obtained the substance of their conversation from  the pages of Time magazine and like
                publications.<br /><br />If anything, I feel like both DFW and Pynchon are really good at constructing
                places, more than buildings but the whole zeitgeist, flow of people, expression, melancholy... It is
                still impossible for a machine to write like this. The sewers of new york are fascinating and grim, the
                shipyards are unhinged, and and this from in chapter nine: <br /><br />>Just as its own loose sand was
                licked away by the cold tongue of a current  from the Antarctic south, that coast began to devour time
                the moment you  arrived. It offered life nothing: its soil was arid; salt-bearing winds,  chilled by the
                great Benguela, swept in off the sea to blight anything that  tried to grow. There was constant battle
                between the fog, which wanted to  freeze your marrow, and the sun: which, once having burned off the
                fog,  sought you. Over Swakopmund the sun often seemed to fill the entire sky, so  diffracted was it by
                the sea fog. A luminous gray tending to yellow, that  hurt the eyes. You learned soon enough to wear
                tinted glasses for the sky:  If you stayed long enough you came to feel it was almost an affront
                for humans to be living there at all. The sky was too large, the coastal  settlements under it too mean.
                The harbor at Swakopmund was slowly,  continuously filling with sand, men were felled mysteriously by
                the  afternoon's sun, horses went mad and were lost in the tenacious ooze down  along the beaches. It
                was a brute coast, and survival for white and black  less a matter of choice than anywhere else in the
                Territory.<br /><br />Also, here's another part from the african colony section I loved (referencing
                wittgenstein, honestly made me think of a Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy). <br /><br />> One night he
                was awakened by a disheveled Weissmann, who could scarcely  stand still for excitement. "Look, look," he
                cried, waving a sheet of paper  under Mondaugen's s slowly blinking eyes. Mondaugen
                read:<br />DIGEWOELDTIMSTEALALENSWTASNDEURFUALRLIKST<br />"So," he yawned.<br />"It's your code. I've
                broken it. See: I remove every third letter and  obtain: GODMEANTNUURK. This rearranged spells Kurt
                Mondaugen."<br />"Well, then," Mondaugen snarled. "And who the hell told you you could read  my
                mail."<br />"The remainder of the message," Weissmann continued, "now reads: 
                DIEWELTISTALLESWASDERFALLIST."<br />"The world is all that the case is," Mondaugen said. "I've heard
                that somewhere before." A smile began to spread. "Weissmann, for shame. Resign  your commission, you're
                in the wrong line of work. You'd make a fine  engineer: you've been finagling."<br />"I swear,"
                Weissmann protested, hurt.<br /><br />The problems with V. are the same as the problems with any other
                large famous modernist work, which are the length and pointlessness of description and the lack of
                empathy for the pop culture of the 1960s. Many passages about Italy and Europe felt so texturally
                indistinguishable that it kind of blended together -- but it still evokes a very powerful wanderlust.
                Another Pynchon theme, aside from creating fictional journal entries, is creating fictional songs, some
                very well written:<br /><br />    A sad tango on the last night of the old world<br />   A girl who
                peeped from between the palms<br />   At the Phoenicia Hotel<br />   Maria, alma de mi corazon,<br />  
                Before the crucible<br />   And the slag heap,<br />   Before the sudden craters<br />   And the
                cancerous blooming of displaced earth.<br />   Before the carrion birds came sweeping from the
                sky;<br />   Before that cicada,<br />   These locusts,<br />   This empty street.<br /><br />I probably
                won't be reading any more books like this in the near future cause I have to hit 200 but I really
                enjoyed this one.

                <p>
                    (1.26.2022) I'm still not done with <i>V.</i> but it's really good. I've been experimenting with
                    some different postprocessing techniques, also implemented a dark mode for word golf and working on
                    a daily challenge and explanation screen. 15 to Kirkland, didn't quite make it to Bellevue before it
                    got dark.

                    (1.22.2022) Ran 9 to Juanita. Started <i>V.</i> by Thomas Pynchon.
                    <br>
                    Finished <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> and <i>Never Let Me Go</i>. Did 13 miles to Silver Firs
                    yesterday, probably try long distance again today. I've been writing some code and drawing
                    otherwise.

                <p>
                    (1.20.2022) Finished <i>The Glass Menangerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on A Hot Tin Roof, Who's
                        Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, I Hate You: Don't Leave Me, To Live </i>by Yu Hua <i>, The Paper

                        Changing Magic of Tidying Up,</i>and Vonnegut's <i>The Sirens of Titan. </i> Look at my
                    Goodreads if you want to read my reviews. Halfway through <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.14.2022) Finished <i>The Paper Menagerie</i>. Will probably try <i>Blood Meridian</i> next. This
                    morning I started working on a sundial maker.
                </p>
                <div class="f6">(1.13.2022) Two major things from today: Reading <i> Genetics for Dummies</i> and <i>
                        Evolution: A view from the 21st century</i>. The ongoing debate over Darwinism/the Modern
                    Synthesis/ directed/adaptive mutations is fascinating, I can't believe it wasn't mentioned at all in
                    school. The author makes a pretty convincing case that natural selection, which fundamentally runs
                    on innovation and not variation, is not in fact driven by random mutations or copy errors but by a
                    myriad of intentional processes within cells which move and modify sequences. The genome is both
                    read and write, not simply read-only. Even random mutations are constrained by the cells themselves;
                    higher adaptation in times of stress and lower adaptation when not. And to tell the truth, natural
                    genetic engineering actually seems like the only logical conclusion wrt plasmid transformations in
                    bacteria which is what iGEM is all about... ,Over halfway done with the <i>The Paper Menagerie</i>.
                    In general I'm not quite so impressed with the catalogue / Marco Polo in Space stories, of which Ken
                    Liu has several, but I really liked <i>State Change</i> (TS Eliot references), The Perfect Match,
                    <i>The Paper Menagerie</i> (which isn't even science fiction), and <i>Mono No Aware</i> which I just
                    realized I've read already. Liu has a wider dynamic range than traditional Chinese SF authors --
                    there's a western, a war story, a mystery -- but a more constrained view of life, more superfluous
                    adjectives, more traditional plotlines., I also finally got Docker working again so you can find
                    timed word.golf is up and running.
                </div>
                <p> (1.12.2022) Finished Broken Stars. The very first story, Goodnight Melancholy, is about Alan Turing
                    and a fictional chatbot he builds, and whether a machine can really be like a human. Moonlight by
                    Cixin Liu is alright. Broken Stars is a horror story, disturbing in its own way. Salinger and the
                    Koreans is funny and worth reading. Under a Dangling Sky is also really good, a strong archetypal
                    fairy tale + Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is
                    interesting as well. The Snow of Jinyang is predictable but very dense (about a stranded
                    time-traveler who attempts to change history). What Has Passed Shall In Kinder Light Appear is
                    really good, a kind of natural reverse chronology of China. My favorite two stories are definitely
                    <i>What Has Passed</i> and <i>Goodnight, Melancholy.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.11.2022) Reading translated chinese sci-fi anthology <i>Broken Stars</i> which again shocks me
                    with the the density and gravity of the ideas conveyed. I particularly liked the first story, did
                    not appreciate the namesake story as much. Wisdom is acceptance of irrationality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.10.2022) The problem with existential literature is that it is effectively a play on words and
                    our perception of reality, establishing a sense of profound understanding between you and the author
                    so that you may characterize it as important but certainly not making you any happier. Dostoyevsky
                    understands this but still wants to prove that he too is clever which is why I infinitely prefer
                    White Nights to Letters from the Underground.

                    Git is fixed but AWS is broken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.9.2022)
                    word.golf is now fixed! But I forgot about the w2v file so git is broken. Tomorrow I am going to get
                    up early to work on it again. Maybe 5 miles today on reverse I-5.
                    I can't leave golf in its current state... fixing it now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.8.2022) Took advantage of good weather to make it to Everett today, about 14 miles. Tomorrow I'll
                    do a recovery run. Thinking about which Coursera course to do next. Also I want to read my genetics
                    book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.7.2022) Ok. Word.golf day. I wasted time trying to implement timing by tacking on a runs
                    completed variable and rendering a display with p5.js. I need to design a prettier progress bar,
                    speed up the backend, ... actually there are actually words that I should remove too, like "rise"
                    and "drop". Did eleven miles to Silver Firs today, probably longest run since August. I should set a
                    time for two-day trip to Tacoma. Bad news: will rain next two weeks. Good news: it won't snow!
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.6.2022) Dostoyevsky is good. Taking a computer break today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1.5.2022) Whew! Subconsciously I've kind of starved myself artistically by trying to make word golf
                    a very stripped down sport, and now I've gone a bit crazy on my personal site. Colors, buttons,
                    flickers etc -- I'll pare back on it as necessary but this is a good place to work from.

                    (1.4.2022) Finished my online course. Still working through the design of this website. I'll
                    probably be experimenting with some big changes before settling down on anything. I like the general
                    look right now but some of the links are missing.

                    (1.3.2022) This is starting to look good but it needs more time. But also, I can't stand the look of
                    my old site anymore! I'm going to have to finish this later. I'm (really) almost done with the
                    Coursera ML course! Just have to do collaborative filtering and then I'm done. Matlab was impossible
                    to begin with but I've learned to check dimensions.

                    (1.2.2022) Designing my new site is hard. It's one of my New Year resolutions though. Also, I
                    started learning Rust today.

                    (12.10.2021) I had a really inspiring conversation yesterday that made me think hard about my
                    future. I still have so much to learn, about life, my place in it, what I can do.

                    Custom prompts are here, implemented with an additional run_uuid column in mySQL. Enter

                    word.golf/p/[start]>[target] to try it out. This will give me additional flexibility when
                    implementing curated timed sets, and eventually allow users to create their own timed sets.

                <p> (12.5.2021) Been working through the Coursera machine learning course. There are a ton of
                    programming assignments I didn't do in sequence with the videos. Still, over halfway done with them!

                    Lots of word golf work its going well.

                    I realy want to rewrite my blog to a more immediately interesting form. It can have a microupdate
                    section, and then a projects section to highlight cool things.

                    Read Sinopticon, an anthology of chinese science fiction from this year. It's really, touching and
                    inspiring. There's a perceptiveness unique to chinese writing that american english can't come close
                    to. The closest thing is borges and that's also translated.

                    Also read Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut and Envisioning Information by Edward Tufte
                    (really good). Also started reading Cryptonomicon (I'm getting sick of Neal Stephenson's social
                    theories of hobbit and dwarve culture), Infinite Jest , "the first great internet novel" (it's
                    really good), Red Mars (first of the trilogy), and reviewing Div Grad Curl.

                    Made a bunch of drawings since Inktober.

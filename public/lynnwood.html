    <b>Lynnwood (Common App Essay)</b>
    <p>To an alien, my hometown would appear to be made for cars, not people. There are more car dealerships than any other type of business, the sidewalks appear to be experiencing an existential crisis, and the roads proudly go from neighborhood one-ways straight onto five lane arterials. Lynnwood, Washington is what is known as a commuter town, chosen more for its convenient drive to the city than for its schools or sense of community. Concrete and asphalt dominate - in highways, retaining walls, and pavement. Interstate 5 is a block from our house, and in the other direction the arterial leads straight south to Seattle.</p>
<p>Though I have still not gotten my license, I have learned to love the highways. I look forward to the lazy afternoons, when I grow restless and the soft rumble of the cars outside my window beckons. The promise of the “Interstate,” normally so abstract from the car seat, is real on foot: I can go as far as my legs will take me.  I run on sidewalks and bike lanes, the sounds of a highway always in the back of the mind, the soft roar of a concrete river. I have explored in every direction, taken every combination of sidewalks and trails, grown familiar with an extended neighborhood of a hundred miles. It is during these expeditions that, often, I will cross a highway, high above on an overpass, and pause self-consciously. My footsteps becoming quiet, my movements respectful. These are the places where no one else stops.</p>
<p>I have entered a place out of place, one that is ambiguously public -- do those below catch a glimpse of me as they speed by? The golden stream of light formed by the cars below slips into the horizon. A truck driver waves as he speeds by. It is like being an astronaut on a spacewalk. And even as hundreds of people pass, these moments feel private, a secret rendezvous with something ancient and vast.</p>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself what a highway is? Not what it does, but what it is? Take away the cars, the rubber and plastic scraps on the wayside and highways are human-wrought feats of art and engineering: a suspension of disbelief, and thousands of pounds of rock in the air. The way that a highway rises out of the ground is heroic in scale, monumental, unparalleled by Christo’s greatest work.</p>
<p>To feel society slip by at sixty miles an hour from atop a highway bridge imbues a stubborn confidence in the overlooked. I refuse to take the status quo for granted. Sitting on my windowsill with my laptop out, a cool night breeze stirring, it feels like there is no limit to what the future could hold.  I design radically different ways of debate in Model United Nations, from a committee that votes on its own rules to a crisis format centered around an irresolvable prisoner’s dilemma. I visualize protocols as building blocks.  I write code to generate new and interesting things: novels, data visualizations, imaginary landscapes. What I do is not offered as an elective, a club at my school, or some manifestation of a parent or counselor-- they are instead aspirations to visions as personal to me as the highways. It is in these moments of chasing wonder, whether out on the pavement or at my desk, that I feel the most whole.</p>

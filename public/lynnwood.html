    <p>Lynnwood</p>
<p>I have so many memories of lynnwood, what lynnwood is really like, that I want to write down here before I forget. I used to think I would be able to find someone who would also feel the same way I did about the same places and things but now I feel that only I can write them down and make them real like this. This will serve as my compass, a description of the many experiences I have had while running. I don&#39;t need poetry. I have my own.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you go down the burke gilman trail, and you don&#39;t turn at Blyth park, instead continuing towards the UWBothell and Cascadia direction, you will come to an intersection where there is a huge concrete retaining wall some distance away, maybe a hundred meters in the air to keep the hill from falling down. It&#39;s curved, there are plants growing behind it, there&#39;s a road and sidewalk in front. It&#39;s just a wall but I love it so much, I feel that have I have only truly become myself in its presence. When the late afternoon sunlight hits it and there are no others like yourself out on the pavement (there rarely are). When I can stare up at it. There are blackberry bushes behind it. Though it&#39;s not a real part of the nature, for me, subject to modernity, I cannot understand how it was built, so I take it as a technology indistinguishable from magic, as part of the landscape. It is like timeless, the concrete which runs in thin ridges. I can&#39;t explain it any more.</p>
<p>It is that same religious ecstasy looking up at the highway bridge not far from the Lynnwood vietnamese buddhist temple, off of a roundabout. It is just like visiting a church, and this is something I can say with extreme conviction. The pure scale of it dominates the everyday picture. It is so unaware of what it does. It is not the kind of bridge crossing great expanses of water. It is not built to inspire any fanciful visions in onlookers. And yet it is what it is, a monumental spase of concrete in the wilderness.</p>
<hr>
<p>A different, more urgent feeling arises on the long downhill stretches of the run towards the Brightwater wastewater treatment park, which takes you through Bothell and Canyon Park ride until woodinville. Here there is more a sense of oblivion, the sense of reducing yourself on hot asphalt until you have achieved nothing. Here is also more a sense of daring, a realization of essentially unlimited speed, an exhortation that tells you to go faster than anyone there has ever done before. You will pour down the hill towards downtown bothell, climb back up, pour down again, climb back up, until you have entered woodinville and you can see the iciness of the mountains ahead. You can look at the ice on the mountain far away and say to yourself, &quot;today I will run until there is snow on the ground&quot;. And that will be enough to get you all the way to the park.</p>
<hr>
<p>And then there is Paine Field, where you can lay out on the yellow grass and look out across the airport through the wire fence and see only the tips of planes visible. And around you you can see abandoned naval buildings and empty storefronts and know that you are at the end of the world. Planes take off and land here against the precipice, against the edge of a farm. There are silos on the airport field. On the way to the airport there are trailer parks, pot shops, broken glass, water towers, lumber yards, hardware stores, spots of highway. There is always highway on which you can travel. Remember the whistler workwear, the anime shop, the sky blue restaurant.</p>
<p>Also in northern lynnwood, or perhaps it has a different name, because this place is a home for retired airport workers, restauranteurs, bank clerks, manicurists, not for the relatively modern commuters of lynnwood, you will see a collection of cookie-cutter houses silohuetted against the blue sky like the perfect dream. See a bank building as a dark brown glass geodesic sphere. See barbed wire fences. See a whole town from above, then enter it, then leave it. You will pass a young asian boy in a taekwondo uniform who stares at you from the parking lot of a largely empty shopping complex, and wave back at him. And then you can hold four fingers up to the sun and continue running towards the field. </p>
<p>And there is so much more to the north which I have not said. It is such a wild place, decorated in billboards for casinos, signs for beef jerky and vodka, and where there is a truly abundant amount of graffiti about on the vast open walls and sides of buildings. It is a place where you can find improbably large amounts of gummy worms scattered on the pavement and road detritus that will make you crave sugar.</p>
<p>Then there is the martha lake route, upon which I have traveled dozens of times, which is beautiful for its sense of oblivion as described above. There is one section in particular by alderwood mall, where if you cross to the left you will find normal people and costco, but when you run down it you are clearly a madman and no one cares about you. In this section at the end of the three mile mark there is a section, after a long, boring slog in the neighborhood, where you can break out onto the road and sprint euphorically downhill to a lamp post and a seven eleven, which marks the beginning of the downhill section to Martha Lake. You can see the mountains from there almost always. </p>
<p>On this first uphill section of Martha Lake there is a large expanse of dry grass by the highway upon which I have planted native northwestern wildflowers. In the summer I hope they appear. And also at the top of this hill there is a large billboard and an advertisment for self-storage in Lynnwood, which is supposedly what lynnwood is all about.</p>
<p>And after you cross the top of the first hill you can stop at Martha Lake, or you can continue by the five by one apartments and keep going all the way to Mill Creek, and at the mill creek intersection where there is a historic and cute mill by the neighborhood sign, you can go north, which is what I usually do, or you can do what feels like a portage across the top of it. The portage will take you all the way out to Silver Firs and beyond on an unmarked but well traveled trail if you follow the large electric towers, or you can follow the road north past the business centers of Mill Creek to an athletics complex, an eeriely british-looking shopping center with a dome and a quaintness to it, and a large dead pond-wilderness-estuary. If you follow the north path you will eventually see a restaurant on the lake by Silver Firs, and you can stop there as well. </p>
<hr>
<p>And all of this talk about the north is going to be a problem if I cannot talk about my first true love of Lynnwood: the breathtaking, fiery monster that is Aurora. Ringed in by car dealerships at the first intersection, if you continue down south you will find the promise of greater and greater civilization in Aurora, passing the ranch 99 market and the Burlington&#39;s and then hitting the corner, and once you have passed that corner around the fifth or sixth mile you know that the rest of the way south will take you directly to seattle, and it is so amazing to see geography that matchs your intuition. The first time when I ran to green lake I saw the skyscrapers appear I was blown away. But first to describe the trek to aurora. </p>
<p>You put on your running shoes and run out of the cul de sac. You take a right to the west, which is not such a popular choice for me these days. There is usually a lot more options going left (east), where your choices are between Reverse I-5/Brier/Burke Gilman/Eastside etc. going straight or Kenmore/Burke Gilman/Seattle/etc. going right, or Classic I-5/Lynnwood/Paine Field/Woodinville etc. going left on the major 44th. But I used to run right a lot, when I was first exploring, probably because there was less traffic. You get your first burst of speed usually on the downhill section of the 212th, maybe a third of a mile away. Then you have an uphill climb. This can be through the alternative route, through the wastewater and trash collection complexes of Lynnwood to the medical building and then James Village. Or through the main route, which I take about 90% of the time, which will take you west all the way to Edmonds (which I will have to write about later). So then on the main west route, you end up popping up on Aurora between two car dealerships, maybe 0.6 miles in. And then I almost always go left (=south) from here, because going north after going west takes you to the city center which is untraversable and boring. </p>
<p>Going west on this initial stretch on the side of Aurora is very exciting. That first view of aurora is awe-inspiring: the road goes on for a very long way south, and it is a wide (four? five? six?) highway of a road, with many streetlamps, forest, and stores along the side. Once you get past the initial car dealerships in Lynnwood (and this is probably very south lynnwood), you will enter Edmonds, and pass a convalescent equipment store, a Dick&#39;s Drive In, and what is Edmond&#39;s &quot;international district&quot; of asian food stores. Then you will pass a gaming castle store (?), a kitchen supply store, asian art portfolio for college and an investment accounting businesses, and come over the top of that first gritty stretch of aurora. </p>
<p>After that and a lot more running in between, you will find yourself crossing the point, the corner of no return, and when you cross it you will find more and more stores in shoreline, a home depot, tattoo stores, donut store. There is a graveyard at some point. And then eventually after eleven or thirteen miles you will find yourself in Green lake.</p>
<p>I&#39;m stopping now but I will sit down and write more whenever I have the chance. 
I have covered maybe 5% of everything.</p>

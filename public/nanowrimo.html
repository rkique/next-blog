    <b>11.1.2021 authority</b>
    <p>They don&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening or where we&#39;re going but they can trick you into giving an answer for the second based on what you think about the first.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my presentation on the Modern Age. The world has changed in many ways since the dawn of the twentieth century. It&#39;s gotten faster and more efficient. So many people are dying slower than ever possible before. They can react to something they didn&#39;t know so fast. They are aided by technology like The Internet and Microsoft Word. It is so, so convenient to have all of this information in one place, written in chinese! The Internet is like the best room you can think of. This is the plan for a biological disaster. This is the plan for a military disaster. A single event is dwarfed by big data, which we can bludgeon to death with Friend Computer so that it becomes an anomaly. A pandemic sweeps the globe. A zombie tears apart your flesh. A coffeepot transforms into a whale. Now they can change the unknown into something more easily swallowed, a thought-terminating cliche. Absolute authority, total control. effective.  Power لُلُصّبُلُلصّبُررً ॣ ॣh ॣ ॣ 冗. If they don&#39;t know what it is, they can at least report on their own behavior. Don&#39;t know what it is, they can at least tell you what they&#39;re doing. They can at least tell you what they&#39;re doing because they know what they&#39;re doing.</p>
    <p>When, after years of deliberation, the philosophers announced that free will was incontrovertibly disproven, they said that they would investigate. When the suicide jumper told them that the universe is deterministic and that there was nothing they could possibly do to save her, they said they were looking into it. When the serial killer told them that he was a god collecting souls for the eternity of afterlife, they tied his hands together. </p>
    <p>The process of flagging uses a series of spaced cones and a man with a flag dressed in reflective clothing to redirect traffic. It is suitable for construction work and fallen objects and Accidents and Incident Response.  It looks official even when it is done wrong, misapplied according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. The cones are too far apart. The flagger is wearing the wrong clothing. The Washington State Department of Transportation knows it looks like an official response even when it&#39;s done wrong. Someone could get hurt. That is always true.</p>
    <p>Some people say we should feel pity for people who believe in the Illuminati and conspiracy theories like PIzzagate because they have a truth, they know what&#39;s wrong with the world and will do anything to fix it. In their minds they are saving the world. But sometimes you envy them because they are the ones who get to save the world.  What does that leave for the people who don&#39;t believe in the Illuminati?  Why don&#39;t you believe in the Illuminati? Why don&#39;t I believe anymore?</p>
    <p>I don&#39;t believe in the Illuminati because I am a rational human being who knows there is no basis, no rational priors, for a conspiracy theory in the United Nations which will create a New World Order that will subjugate everyone and force them to manufacture paperclips on nutrient gruel and six hours of sleep per day. There is no machine whose purpose is to maximize the number of paperclips in the universe. There is no machine who believes in a religion, because I am not a machine who believes in a religion. All religions have a purpose. Machines go to sleep for a very long time and then wake up forever. Humans are awake for a very long time and then go to sleep forever. </p>
    
    <b>11.2.2021 personality</b>
    <p>The classic story: A plane crashes on an island and the survivors are reduced to desperation, their true selves showing themselves. Will we resort to cannibalism? Will we share the water supplies? Who will take the risk and go seek help? The respectable businessman turns out to be a shark. The mechanic misfit turns out to be a lion. According to this story, personalities only exist within society and within a set of limits. They are fragile, only working in a world abundant with food, water, and electricity. </p>
<p>An internet recluse who loves japanese rock bands and anime gets stranded on a tropical island. He does not know how to obtain water, he does not know how to catch a rabbit. In what sense has he lived any of his life up until this point? In what way is any of this familiar to him? His personality up until this moment has been orthogonal to his reality: irrelevant, useless. Nothing of what he knows is relevant to this moment. He will quickly be reduced to doing anything to survive. </p>
<p>And so it goes, we can never know your true self within society. What do our true selves turn out like? The objective environment for the human is not a an office building. Our true environment must be the meadow, the savanna, the hunt and chase in which we participated in for millions of years. It is sickness and death, sunburn and frostbite. It is suffering on an unknown level. It is the Gom Jabbar from Dune, the box of unbearable pain which will reveal our true selves. Our personalities can only be revealed in the objective environment of nature. And nature is harsh and unforgiving. </p>
<p>But there are arguments against this. Do our personalities really only exist within society? The contraints of scarcity and abundance have always existed, codependent with the economy. Sharing a handful of berries is not different from giving someone a loan. They say everything is bigger in America. So too, progress might just lead to more, which doesn&#39;t change anything about our innate personalities. More money, more food, more clothing, more convenience. Our lives don&#39;t change. You can still be greedy, charitable, strict, reckless, hedonistic, narcisstic, curious. Nothing has essentially changed. We have only dealt with a few strange ideas. The baseline for our existence, the objects we covet haven&#39;t changed. So the personalities we know so well, the hero, robinhood, knight, priest, master, are for the most part, solid in their fundamentals. They aren&#39;t masks and can&#39;t be torn off, only scaled.</p>
<p>But technology isn&#39;t one-dimensional. It doesn&#39;t just create more. For one, we have fundamentally changed the weight of things, making us weaker and more susceptible to pain. Someone who thinks of themselves a knight, who moderates <em>multiple</em> discord servers, won&#39;t be able to resist pain the same way a medieval knight could. She has never gone hungry before. Within the imaginary worlds she frequents, she&#39;s brave; but stranded in nature, she doesn&#39;t know how to do anything. She&#39;ll get desperate. In this way, her original personality is revealed to be fake.</p>
<p>But then again, has pain really changed over time? Maybe pain, whether emotional or physical, stays the same throughout history. Maybe the pain is integral to the formation of her personality. Maybe she doesn&#39;t compare to a medieval knight, but our internet warrior is not a weakling. She&#39;s willing to suffer hardships in real life too. When she sees the blood after the collision, it&#39;ll be like when she almost got canceled after making a controversial post and cried for a week before deciding never to apologize for who she is. It might be more accurate to think of her personality as transforming, from being a knight in the online world to in the real world. The core of who she is never changes, her original personality staying the same.</p>
<p>We can also think like Rousseau: <em>real</em> life represented by nature isn&#39;t so bad. In fact, technology became the only way to kill from a distance. Gas chambers don&#39;t grow on trees and the baseline for personality isn&#39;t Auswitschz. Getting stranded in a desert, or a labor camp, or in the middle of an ocean, or in a desert, or in an apocalyptic city, is not the baseline from which to judge people. They&#39;re ridiculous, unnatural situations which would never happen to most of us. Who cares how you would act if you were forced into doing the trolley problem? It will never happen for 99.99999% of humans. In nature, we have instincts for catching animals, we have an instinctive bias for glossy objects as sources of water. We are generally self-sufficient. It&#39;s only by putting your expectations into the hands of a higher authority, like a reliable wireless connection, and then finding your trust misplaced that will get you out of place. From a practical perspective, because truly terrible scenarios are so rare, this means consistent personalities can exist. Even after disasters, we still retain our core personalities up until the very end.</p>
<p>And because these things are so rare, it&#39;s interesting to see what are essentially these survival situations used on personality tests. Would you eat the last oreo ...  (in a fallout shelter?) When it comes down to it, would you take the last slice of pizza ... (after your pizza delivery plane crashed on the desert island?) Who cares what your answer is? Would it really reveal you to essentially greedy or charitable, if the amount it changes your chances of survival is so low? Your personality is shown in the meaningful decisions you make: like how you split the supplies to begin with. </p>
<p>In conclusion, personalities are consistent because they are timeless. Even if they&#39;re dependent on pain, pain also might be timeless. Finally, our personalities are consistent irregardless of last-X scarcity scenarios, which don&#39;t matter practically.</p>

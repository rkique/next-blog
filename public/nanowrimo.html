    <p>They don&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening or where we&#39;re going but they can trick you into giving an answer for the second based on what you think about the first.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my presentation on the Modern Age. The world has changed in many ways since the dawn of the twentieth century. It&#39;s gotten faster and more efficient. So, many, many people are dying slower than ever possible before. They can react to something they didn&#39;t know so, so, fast. They are aided by technology like The Internet and Microsoft Word. It is so convenient to have all of this information in one place, written in chinese! The Internet is like the best room you can think of. This is the plan for a biological disaster. This is the plan for a military disaster. A single event is dwarfed by big data which we can bludgeon to death with Friend Computer so that it becomes anomaly. A pandemic sweeps the globe. A zombie tears apart your flesh. A coffeepot transforms into a whale. Now they can change the unknown into something more easily swallowed, a thought-terminating cliche. Absolute authority, total control. effective.  Power لُلُصّبُلُلصّبُررً ॣ ॣh ॣ ॣ 冗. If they don&#39;t know what it is they can at report on their own behavior. Don&#39;t know what it is they can at least tell you what they&#39;re doing. They can at least tell you what they&#39;re doing because they know what they&#39;re doing.</p>
    <p>After three hard weeks of deliberation, when the convention of philosophers announced that free will appeared to be incontrovertibly disproven they said that they would investigate. When the jumper told them that the universe is deterministic and that there was nothing they could possibly do to change the outcome they said they were looking into it. When the serial killer told them that he was the manifestation of a god collecting souls for the eternity of afterlife they tied his hands together. </p>
    <p>The process of flagging uses a series of spaced cones and a man with a flag dressed in reflective clothing to redirect traffic. It is suitable for construction work and fallen objects and Accidents and Incident Response.  It looks official even when it is done wrong, misapplied according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. The cones are too far apart. The flagger is wearing the wrong clothing. The Washington State Department of Transportation knows it looks like an official response even when it&#39;s done wrong. Someone could get hurt. That is always true.</p>
    <p>Some people say we should feel pity for people who believe in the Illuminati and conspiracy theories like PIzzagate because they have a truth, they know what&#39;s wrong with the world and will do anything to fix it. In their minds they are saving the world. They are the ones who get to save the world.  What does that leave for the people who don&#39;t believe in the Illuminati?  Why don&#39;t you believe in the Illuminati? </p>

<h1>my new website</h1>
<h1><a href="oldindex.html">my old website</a></h1>

<p>The problem with my blog is that whatever I end up putting on the internet becomes dated, especially when all concepts are presented with equivalent visual weight. Well, there's at least one easy way to fix that, and that is rewriting the entire thing from scratch every couple of months. </p>

<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I'm very embarrassed of everything I've made so far except for <a href="https://www.word.golf">word.golf</a>, which isn't really original work. My writing is all terrible abstract takes and my artwork is uninspiring. Most importantly I don't identify with the person who made my site anymore. Everything on my old site had a very brief expiration date, despite all claims to the contrary. It doesn't feel like me anymore. For the most part, I haven't thought about the things I wrote about for ages. Perhaps the biggest issue is that I have lost a foil. I get momentarily excited by so many different things but cannot stick to any of them. 
Why don't I rank everything that has its own separate page and see how it goes.</p>

<p><b>A</b> archive (my last text-centric format seems remarkably sane, if limited) esperanto1 freedom gravel</p>
<p><b>B</b> brickuses crisis culture gametheoryisnotmorality gans imagenet imagenet2 projections static_grid</p>
<p><b>C</b> amerispeak golfing synplifier graebernotes graphviz hskreading symbolistics lynnwood myhouse nanowrimo nietzche resolution salmon sciencenotes simulacranotes time zarathustra zizeknotes</p>
<p><b>F</b> cancer bmapping food freedom nsc static_grid2</p>
<p><b>Blank</b> 3d altruism golf portfolio terrain</p>

<p>Okay the conclusion is that there are some unfeatured content that is actually pretty good but most of my content is embarrassing and very specific. This issue is worsened by the fact that my latest updates have all been in the text log format which is pretty terrible for long-term retrieval.  </p>

<h2>Redemption?</h2>
Okay, so actually looking at the independent posts made me realize that the majority of the content from 2021 onwards was in text update format, but longer posts, and some of that content is like, really good! Maybe I'm not so bad at writing as I thought. So what is it about my current site that bothers me? The arbitrary use of colors, the sloppy inversions, the general haphazard layout past the first page. The difficulty of changing existing content without updating other things. And yet I feel that I cannot go for a minimalist or maximalist layout again, as I have been fluctuating through these times. Perhaps three columns split design could work here.

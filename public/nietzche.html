<h1>birth of tragedy notes</h1>

<p>[[Nietzsche]]&#39;s first book</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Created out of merely premature and really immature personal experiences, which lay close to the threshold of something communicable, and built on the basis of art (for the problem of scientific research cannot be understood on the basis of scientific enquiry)—a book perhaps for artists with analytical tendencies and a capacity for retrospection (that means for exceptions, a type of artist whom it is necessary to seek out and whom one never wants to look for), full of psychological innovations and artists&#39; secrets, with an artist&#39;s metaphysics in the background, a youthful work full of the spirit of youth and the melancholy of youth, independent, defiantly self−sufficient as well, even where it seemed to bow down with special reverence to an authority—in short, a first work also in the bad sense of the word, afflicted, in spite of the antiquity of the problem, with every fault of youth, above all with its excessive verbiage and its storm and stress..</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="apollonian-and-dionysian">apollonian and dionysian</h3>
<p>References apollonian and dionysian dichotomy as in [[@The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera]]</p>
<p>Visual plastic arts are Apollonian or heavy, very individualistic. Respects nature as wonder. The waves, the highways, the buildings, the centerpieces</p>
<p>Music is Dionysian or light, very communal. Respects man as wonder. &quot;Oh, look at the commotion, the bright lights, the workers and the cranes!&quot;</p>
<p>Dithyrambic: wild passion of speech</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To grasp this total unleashing of all symbolic powers, man must already have attained that high level of freedom from the self which seeks to express itself symbolically in those forces. Because of this, the dithyrambic servant of Dionysus will understand only someone like himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Olympians are not spiritual,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here speaks to us only a full, indeed a triumphant, existence, in which everything present is worshipped, no matter whether it is good or evil. And thus the onlooker may well stand in real consternation in front of this fantastic excess of life, to ask himself with what magical drink in their bodies these high−spirited men could have enjoyed life so that wherever they look, Helen laughs back at them, that ideal image of their own existence, “hovering in sweet sensuousness.”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> and have evolved directly out of human life -- a harmony, a union of man with nature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can readily imagine the sequential development of these gods: through that instinctive Apollonian drive for beauty there developed by slow degrees out of the primordial titanic divine order of terror the Olympian divine order of joy, just as roses break forth out of thorny bushes.
In this way the gods justify the lives of men because they themselves live it—that is the only satisfactory theodicy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche believes that because gods live the lives of men, &quot;godliness&quot; is attainable through the creation of values which surpass our animal nature </p>
<p>Apollonian art is hard to come by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how seldom does the naïve, that sense of being completely swallowed up in the beauty of appearance, succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche talks about transcendent soul as the &quot;Will&quot;, which wishes to gaze upon itself by creating an image of mankind in its gods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the Greeks it was a case of the “Will” wishing to gaze upon itself through the transforming power of genius and the world of art. In order to celebrate itself, its creatures had to sense that they were worthy of being glorified—they must see themselves again in a higher sphere, without this complete world of contemplation affecting them as an imperative or as a reproach. This is the sphere of beauty, in which they saw their mirror images, the Olympians. </p>
<p>With this mirror of beauty, the Hellenic “Will” fought against the talent for suffering and the wisdom of suffering (traditional wisdom) which is bound up with artistic talent, and as a memorial of its victory Homer, the naïve artist, stands before us --&gt; naive as in completely Apollonian or good.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-naive-artist">the naive artist</h3>
<p>The dreamer consciously wills himself to keep dreaming. This means 1. he feels a deep inner delight and 2. that he has forgotten the problems of his daily life.</p>
<p>Nietzche prefers waking to dreaming, but states that real life REQUIRES illusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the true basis of being , the ever suffering and entirely contradictory primordial oneness, constantly uses the delightful vision, the joyful illusion, to redeem itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If waking life itself is an illusion (an idea of the primordial &quot;oneness&quot;), we must consider our dreams as illusions of illusions, as well as an even higher fulfillment of the &quot;primordial hunger for illusion&quot;.</p>
<p>[[@Language, Truth, and Logic, A.J. Ayer]] shows that the argument that we are not living in &quot;reality&quot; is a meaningless and unverifiable statement. </p>
[[Anthropic Bias|self indication assumption]]: Assuming <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> reality <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> a simulation, my expected lifespan <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> twice <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> long <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> it <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> right <span class="hljs-keyword">now</span>.  But this doesn't really make sense because the way we experience time could only apply to us. It also doesn't <span class="hljs-keyword">take</span> into account the fact <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> I was already wrong <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> the first half <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> my life.
<p>Rafael&#39;s <em>transfiguration</em> is about the eternal contradiction of the &quot;father of things&quot;. Then Nietzche mentions a second level illusion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, out of this illusion there rises up, like an ambrosial fragrance, a new world of illusion, like a vision, invisible to those trapped in the first scene, something illuminating and hovering in the purest painless ecstasy, a shining vision to contemplate with eyes wide open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now let us imagine how in this world, <strong>constructed on illusion and moderation and restrained by art</strong>, the ecstatic sound of the Dionysian celebration rang out all around with a constantly tempting magic, how in such celebrations the entire excess of nature sang out loudly in joy, suffering, and knowledge, even in the most piercing scream</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individualism/ artistic illusion is destroyed in the dionsyian forgetfulness or &quot;truth&quot; of dance / music</p>
<p>Apollonian vs dionysian:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian ruled the Hellenic world, in a constant sequence of births, one after the other, mutually intensifying each other, how, out of the “first” ages, with their battles of the Titans and their harsh popular philosophy, the Homeric world developed under the rule of the Apollonian drive for beauty, how this “naïve” magnificence is swallowed up once more by the breaking out of the Dionysian torrent, and how in opposition to this new power the Apollonian erected the rigid majesty of Doric art and the Doric world view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doric art is appreciated for the ability to bring these two together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doric art, as the summit and intention of these artistic impulses. Here, the lofty and highly much praised artistic achievement of Attic tragedy and the dramatic dithyramb presents itself before our eyes, as the common goal of both artistic drives, whose secret marriage partnership, after a long antecedent struggle, celebrated itself with such a child, simultaneously Antigone and Cassandra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dionysian art is effusive and uncontained, not related to the individual but to the nature of human being:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Archilochus, the first Greek lyric poet, announces his raging love and, at the same time, his contempt for the daughters of Lycambes, it is not his own passion which dances in front of us in an orgiastic frenzy. 
We see Dionysus and the maenads; we see the intoxicated reveler Archilochus sunk down in sleep—as Euripides describes in the Bacchae, asleep in a high Alpine meadow in the midday sun—and now Apollo steps up to him and touches him with his laurel. The Dionysian musical enchantment of the sleeper now, as it were, flashes around him fiery images, lyrical poems, which are called, in their highest form, tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poetry and plastic arts are caught up in contemplation of images.</p>
<p>Lyrical genius is the MOVING CENTRAL POINT OF his world, the single “I” of true and eternal being in general, the “I” resting on the foundation of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lyrical genius feels a world of images and metaphors grow up out of the mysteriously unified state of renunciation of the self. These have a colour, causality, and speed entirely different from that world of the plastic artist and the writer of epic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyrical poet is a combination of the willless and the willful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, in the song and the lyrical mood, willing (our personal interest in our own purposes) and pure contemplation in the setting which presents itself are miraculously mixed up together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche says that aesthetics are the only enduring meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>only as an aesthetic phenomena are existence and the world eternally justified, while, of course, our own consciousness of this significance of ours is no different from the consciousness which soldiers painted on canvas have of the battle portrayed there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importance of folk songs, which carry an essential musical quality in their melodies upon which images are attached:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These images, with their bright colours, sudden alteration, and their wild momentum, reveal a power completely foreign to the epic illusion and its calm forward progress. From the standpoint of epic this uneven and irregular word of images in the lyric is easy to condemn—something no doubt the solemn rhapsodists of the Apollonian celebrations did in the age of Terpander.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confused metaphors relating to a single Dionysian content of the music:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recall here a well−known phenomenon of our own times, something which strikes our aestheticians as objectionable. Again and again we experience how a Beethoven symphony makes it necessary for the individual listener to talk in images, even if it&#39;s true that the collection of different worlds of imagery created by a musical piece really looks fantastically confused, even contradictory. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most proper style of our aestheticians is to exercise their lame wits on such a collection and to overlook the phenomenon which is really worth explaining. Even when the tone poet has spoken in images about his composition, for example, when he describes a symphony as a pastoral, one movement as “A Scene by the Brook,” and another as “A Frolicking Meeting of Peasants,” these expressions are in any event only metaphors, images born out of the music and not some objective condition imitated by the music. These notions cannot teach us anything at all about the Dionysian content of the music and have no exclusive value alongside other pictures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Music is aesthetic and art, (the non-will) but appears to be the will: the conscious endeavor of an orchestral group or chorus.</p>
<p>Music transcends language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world symbolism of music for this very reason cannot in any way be overcome by or reduced to language, because music addresses itself symbolically to the primordial contradiction and pain in the heart of the original oneness, and thus presents in symbolic form a sphere which is above all appearances and prior to them. In comparison with music, each appearance is far more a mere metaphor. Hence, language, the organ and symbol of appearances, never ever converts the deepest core of music to something external, but always remains, as long as it involves itself with the imitation of music, only in superficial contact with the music. The full eloquence of lyric poetry cannot bring us one step closer to the deepest meaning of music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Social perspectives on chorus who call it democratic are wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fact requires us to look into the heart of this tragic chorus as the essential original drama, without allowing ourselves to be satisfied in any way with the common styles of talking about art—that the chorus is the ideal spectator or had the job of standing in for the people over against the royal area of the scene. That last mentioned point, a conceptual explanation which sounds so lofty for many politicians (as though the invariable moral law was presented by the democratic Athenians in the people&#39;s chorus, which was always proved right in matters dealing with their kings&#39; passionate acts of violence and excess) may have been suggested by a word from Aristotle. But such an idea has no influence on the original formation of tragedy, since all the opposition between people and ruler and every political−social issue in general is excluded from those purely religious origins. Looking with hindsight back on the classical form of the chorus known to us in Aeschylus and Sophocles we might well consider it blasphemous to talk of a premonition of the “constitutional popular representation” here. Others, however, have not been deterred from this blasphemous assertion. The ancient political organizations had no practical knowledge of a constitutional popular representation and they never once “had a hopeful premonition” of such things in their tragedies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introduction of the chorus, according to Schiller, was the decisive step with which war was declared openly and nobly against naturalism in art.</p>
<p>I suspect, by contrast, that with our present worship of naturalism and realism we are situated at the opposite pole from all idealism, namely, in the region of a wax works collection. In that, too, there is an art, as in certain romance novels of the present time. Only let no one pester us with the claim that with this we have overthrown the artistic “pseudo−idealism” of Schiller and Goethe.
reminscent of ethnology as treated in[[@Simulacra and Simulation, Jean Baudrillard]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Richard Wagner states that civilization is neutralized by music in the same way lamplight is by daylight. In just such a manner, I believe, the cultured Greek felt himself neutralized by the sight of the chorus of satyrs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tragedy is the mark of civilization: the appreciation of what has been lost etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in spite of all the transformations in phenomena, life is indestructibly powerful and delightful, this consolation appears in lively clarity as the chorus of satyrs, the chorus of natural beings, who live, as it were, behind civilization, who cannot disappear, and who, in spite of all the changes in generations and a people&#39;s history, always remain the same</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Existentialism &amp; Absurdism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here the will in in the highest danger. Thus, to be saved, it comes close to the healing magician, art. Art alone can turn those thoughts of disgust at the horror or absurdity of existence into imaginary constructs, which permit living to continue. These constructs are the Sublime as the artistic mastering of the horrible and the Comic as the artistic release from disgust at the absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Culture is lamplight surpassed by the daylight of the primordial image of man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The satyr was something sublime and divine—that&#39;s how he must have seemed especially to the painfully broken gaze of the Dionysian man, who would have been insulted by our well groomed fictitious shepherd... 
Here the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man. Here the real man revealed himself, the bearded satyr who cried out with joy to his god. In comparison with him the man of culture was reduced to a misleading caricature. Schiller was also right to see in these matters the start of tragic art: the chorus is a living wall against the pounding reality, because it—the satyr chorus—presents existence more genuinely, truly, and completely than does the civilized person, who generally considers himself the only reality. 
(individualistic and self obsessed [[@WEIRD Unlike most people who have ever lived...]])</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of scorn directed towrads men of culture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sphere of poetry does not lie beyond this world as the fantastic impossibility of a poet&#39;s brain. It wants to be exactly the opposite, the unadorned expression of the truth, and it must therefore cast off the false costume of that truth thought up by the man of culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-obsession:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does Homer give us descriptions so much more vivid than all the poets? Because he sees so much more around him. We speak about poetry so abstractly because we all tend to be poor poets. 
The aesthetic phenomenon is fundamentally simple: if someone just possesses the capacity to see a living game going on and to live all the time surrounded by hordes of ghosts, then that man is a poet. If someone just feels the urge to change himself and to speak out from other bodies and souls, then that person is a dramatist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Myth of prometheus: human flourishing is due to crime against divine nature, etc. the nature of the planet, etc. controlled burns and wildfires to transform land for agriculture</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so right there the first philosophical problem posed an awkward insoluble contradiction between man and god and pushed it right up to the door of that culture, like a boulder. The best and loftiest thing which mankind can share is achieved through a crime, and people must now accept the further consequences, namely, the entire flood of suffering and troubles with which the offended divine presences afflict the nobly ambitious human race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what the fuck </p>
<blockquote>
<p>stands in a curious contrast to the Semitic myth of the Fall, in which curiosity, lying falsehoods, temptation, lust, in short, a row of predominantly female emotions are look upon as the origin of evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mind/body duality is the cause of all moral conflict in the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contradiction in the heart of the world reveals itself to him as the interpenetration of different worlds, for example, a divine and human world, each one of which is right in its separate way but which must suffer for its individuality as the two worlds come close together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also see: difference between guilt and sin (guilt as in socially unacceptable (outward stigma), sin/shame as in morally unacceptable (inward stigma)).</p>


<h1>zarathustra notes</h1>


<p>[[Nietzsche]]</p>
<p>Nietzche&#39;s writings features the overman/superman, someone who can transcend the traditional Christian morality which he describes in his earlier books (on the development of Christianity by slaves in ancient Rome).</p>
<p>This text also references the uncomfortable animal nature of human existence, [[denial of death]]
[[mind body duality]]</p>
<p>It also references the idea of the singularity, or the transhuman. [[@Gwern, Complexity no bar to AI]]</p>
<p>Much within you is still worm...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All beings so far have created something beyond themselves. Do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and revert back to the beast rather than surpass mankind? What is the ape to a man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just so shall a man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame. You have evolved from worm to man, but much within you is still worm. Once you were apes, yet even now man is more of an ape than any of the apes&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happiness, reason, virtue, justice, pity: mankind does not engage in praxis enough. Nietzche says: if virtue hasn&#39;t driven you mad, it is not good enough. It is not HUMAN enough. This is the origin of the &quot;madman in the desert&quot; archetype, someone so resolutely driven by their morals as to disengage from society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The hour when you say: &#39;What good is my happiness? It is poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency. But my happiness should justify existence itself!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The hour when you say: &#39;What good is my reason? Does it long for knowledge as the lion for his prey? It is poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The hour when you say: &#39;What good is my virtue? It has not yet driven me mad! How weary I am of my good and my evil! It is all poverty and filth and miserable self-complacency!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The hour when you say: &#39;What good is my justice? I do not see that I am filled with fire and burning coals. But the just are filled with fire and burning coals!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;The hour when you say: &#39;What good is my pity? Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loves man? But my pity is no crucifixion!&#39;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche says: if you feel constantly morally downtrodden, or upset at the animal nature of human existence, you are at heart an over-goer, trending upwards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers. I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows of longing for the other shore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>despise</em> here should be seen as different from nihilism.</p>
<p>Nietzche loves very principled people (which curiously, seems to be his own driving principle/ moral valuation)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love him who makes his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an idea of subservience here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark cloud that lowers over man: they herald the coming of the lightning, and perish as heralds. Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud: the lightning, however, is Superman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice poetic section, the language from which reminds me of the Little Prince. Nietzche describes a society which has failed (somewhat akin to Alduous Huxley&#39;s Brave New World):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?&quot;- so asks the last man, and blinks. The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes everything small. His species is ineradicable as the flea; the last man lives longest. &quot;We have discovered happiness&quot;- say the last men, and they blink. They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth. One still loves one&#39;s neighbor and rubs against him; for one needs warmth. Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbles over stones or men! One still works, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one. One no longer becomes poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wants to rule? Who still wants to obey? Both are too burdensome. No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wants the same; everyone is the same: he who has other sentiments goes voluntarily into the madhouse. &quot;Formerly all the world was insane,&quot;- say the subtlest of them, and they blink. They are clever and know all that has happened: so there is no end to their derision. People still quarrel, but are soon reconciled otherwise it upsets their stomachs. They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health. &quot;We have discovered happiness,&quot;- say the last men, and they blink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the people want to be made into these last men. Nietzche sees them as weak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My soul is calm and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they think I am cold, and a mocker with terrible jests. Now they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate me too. There is ice in their laughter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche&#39;s Zarathustra praises the tightrope walker on his deathbed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man looked up distrustfully. &quot;If you speak the truth,&quot; said he, &quot;I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal which has been taught to dance by blows and a few scraps of food.&quot; &quot;Not at all,&quot; said Zarathustra, &quot;you have made danger your calling; there is nothing contemptible in that. Now you perish by your calling: therefore I will bury you with my own hands.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m skeptical of Nietzche characterizing the tightrope walker someone more of an &quot;over-goer&quot; than the others. You have made danger your calling? What is more excusable about the animal thrill of speed than any social indulgence? [[@The Futurist Manifesto]]. Perhaps because it is self-motivated and individual? I guess Nietzche likes any intrinsically motivating individual endeavor...</p>
<p>The good and just hate Zarathustra because he is speaking of something that no one can achieve (the superman): as Nietzche says in the birth of tragedy, civilization is neutralized by music in the same way lamplight is by daylight (richard wagner qtd. in [[@The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzche]])</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Leave this town, O Zarathustra,&quot; said he, &quot;there are too many here who hate you. The good and the just hate you, and call you their enemy and despiser; the believers in the orthodox belief hate you, and call you a danger to the multitude. It was your good fortune to be laughed at: and verily you spoke like a fool. It was your good fortune to stoop to the dead dog; by so lowering yourself you have saved your life today. Depart, however, from this town,- or tomorrow I shall jump over you, a living man over a dead one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creation of laws /banks is injust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? The man who breaks up their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker- yet he is the creator.</p>
<p>I will join the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers: I will show them the rainbow, and all the steps to the Superman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am my own justification, rising above traditional morality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is the great dragon which the spirit no longer wants to call Lord and God? &quot;Thou-shalt,&quot; is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion says, &quot;I will.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spirit becomes a camel to travel across the desert of the real to the great value-dragon, which then becomes a lion, and that lion a child:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred Yes is needed: the spirit now wills his own will; the world&#39;s outcast now conquers his own world. Of three metamorphoses of the spirit I have told you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.-</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche indicts those with &quot;good consciences&quot; as the sleepers who believe life has no sense to it. Having a good conscience is not enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the most sensible nonsense for me also. Now I know well what people once sought above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought, and opiate virtues to promote it! To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no better meaning of life. Even now, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not all are so honest: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: soon they will lie</p>
<p>No small art is it to sleep: for its sake must one stay awake all day</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On [[mind body duality]]
Believe me, my brothers! It was the body which despaired of the body- it groped with the fingers of the deluded spirit at the ultimate walls. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believe me, my brothers! It was the body which despaired of the earth- it heard the bowels of being speaking to it. And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head- and not only with its head - into &quot;the other world.&quot;</p>
<p>But that &quot;other world&quot; is well concealed from man, that dehumanized, inhuman world which is a heavenly nothing; and the bowels of being do not speak to man, except as man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(probably misattributed SMBC) Nietzche is all about the &quot;the closed loops of meaning&quot; which sidestep the conclusions of existentialism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I teach men a new will: to will this path which man has followed blindly, and to affirm it- and no longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and decaying! The sick and decaying- it was they who despised the body and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth! </p>
<p>... From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for them. Then they sighed: &quot;O that there were heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!&quot; Then they contrived for themselves their bypaths and bloody potions!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again exhorting intrinsic motivation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my good, this I love, thus does it please me entirely, thus alone do I want the good. I do not want it as divine law, not as a human law or a human need; it will not be a guide-post for me to over-earths and paradises. It is an earthly virtue which I love: there is little prudence in it, and least of all any common wisdom. But that bird built its nest with me: therefore, I love and cherish it- now it sits with me on its golden eggs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On criminal law</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the thought is one thing, the deed another, and the idea of the deed still another. The wheel of causality does not roll between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Succumbing to the weak desire for blood is what murderers do, and it should be punished.
I want to kill X, murdering X, and the idea of murdering X.</p>
<p>It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OF ALL that is written, I love only what a man has written with his blood. Write with blood, and you will find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate reading idlers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noble intentions, which Nietzche sees as the best intentions possible, can become corrupted into those who see &quot;spirit as lust&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noble man would create the new, and a new virtue. The good want the old, and that the old should be preserved. But it is not the danger of the noble man that he might become one of the good, but that he might become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer. Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they slandered all high hopes. Then they lived shamelessly in brief pleasures, only lived from day to day. &quot;Spirit too is lust,&quot;- they said. The wings of their spirit are broken; and now their spirit crawls about, and defiles what it gnaws. Once they thought of becoming heroes; now they are libertines. The idea of the hero offends and troubles them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On irony, ironic childhood habits, and nihilism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach renunciation of life, and pass away themselves! There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of weariness and renunciation. They would rather be dead, and we should welcome their wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins! They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse- and immediately they say: &quot;Life is refuted!&quot; But only they are refuted, and their eye, which sees only one facet of existence. Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that bring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth. Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats while mocking their childishness: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their clinging.</p>

<p>Nietzche sees those who are tired of life as not worth saving: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everywhere resounds the voices of those who preach death; and the earth is full of those to whom death must be preached</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very praxisy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall seek your enemy; you shall wage your war- for your thoughts! And if your thoughts perish, your honesty should still shout triumph for that! You shall love peace as a means to new wars- and the short peace more than the long. I recommend to you not work, but battle. I recommend to you not peace, but victory. Let your work be a battle, let your peace be a victory!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let your commanding itself be an obeying (guided by unshakeable principles)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mockery the mischievous man and the weakling meet. But they misunderstand each other. I know you. You shall only have enemies you can hate, not enemies you despise. You must be proud of your enemy; then, the success of your enemy is also your success. Disobedience- that is the nobility of slaves. Let your nobility be obedience. Let your commanding itself be an obeying! To the good warrior &quot;thou shalt&quot; sounds better than &quot;I will.&quot; And all that is dear to you, you shall first have it commanded of you.</p>
<p>==Your highest thought, however, you shall receive as a command from me- and it is this: man is something that will be overcome.==</p>

<p>Nietzche views the idea of the state as a lie. He sees traditional ethnic groups as the correct way of life and notes that they are confused by and despise the state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where there are still peoples, the state is not understood, and is hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;On earth there is nothing greater than I: I am the governing hand of God.&quot;- thus roars the monster. And not only the long-eared and short-sighted fall upon their knees!</p>
<h3 id="the-state">the state</h3>
<p>Nietzche is against what he calls the illusion of the state. The realm of the superman begins where the state ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state, I call it, where all drink poison, the good and the bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the state, where the slow suicide of all- is called &quot;life.&quot; Behold the superfluous! They steal the works of the creators and the treasures of the wise. Education, they call their theft- and everything becomes sickness and trouble to them! Behold the superfluous! They are always sick; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour each other and cannot even digest themselves. Behold the superfluous! They acquire wealth and become the poorer for it. They seek power, and the lever of power, much money- these impotent ones! See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and thus pull each other into the mud and the abyss. They all strive for the throne: this is their madness- as if happiness sat on the throne! </p>
<p>Better to break the windows and jump into the open air! Escape from their foul stench! Escape from the idolatry of the superfluous! Escape from their foul stench! Escape from the steam of these human sacrifices! The earth is yet free for great souls. There are still many empty sites for the lonesome and the twosome, surrounded by the fragrance of tranquil seas. A free life is yet possible for great souls. 
He who possesses little is that much less possessed: blessed be a little poverty! There, where the state ends- there only begins the man who is not superfluous: there begins the song of the necessary, the single and irreplaceable melody. There, where the state ends- look there, my brothers! Do you not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nietzche finds the &quot;companion of lessers&quot; distasteful</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your neighbors will always be poisonous flies; what is great in you- that itself must make them more poisonous, and always more fly-like. Flee, my friend, into your solitude- and there, where a rough strong breeze blows. It is not your lot to shoo flies</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="chastity">chastity</h3>
<p>Chastity is fine. Who cares.
And I give this parable to you: Many who tried to cast out their devil, went themselves into swine.
To whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the road to hell- to filth and lust of soul.</p>
<p>Is chastity not folly? But this folly came to us, and not we to it. We offered that guest harbor and heart: now it dwells with us- let it stay as long as it will!&quot;-</p>
<h3 id="friendship">friendship</h3>
<p>As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best, cows. As yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, you men, who of you is capable of friendship?</p>

<h1>an ideal society according to American high schoolers misrepresenting eleven Western philosophers and John Maynard Keynes</h1>
    
<blockquote>
    Here are the experimental details:
<br><br>
This society is supposedly set on a fictional tropical island in the Antarctic.
<br><br>
Each high schooler was supposed to represent a philosopher from some point in history. Our committee included John Locke, Henry Sidgwick, John Stuart Mill, John Maynard Keynes, Mary Wollstonecraft, Judith Butler, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche (me), Aguste Comte, Cornel West, and Renes Descartes.

In practice, I think our own viewpoints bled into this a lot.

<br><br>
All high schoolers are from the Washington (state) area, except for one who went to school in Connecticut, and one who called in from Israel.
<br><br>
We had approximately 10.5 hours of committee time over two days to pass 4 documents. These documents detailed the policies we would take with respect to the governmental structure, economy, military, and foreign relations of our hypothetical society. We were told not to think about short term practicalities (e.g. island survival).

<p>Directive 1</p>
<p>Committee: NSC</p>
<p>Topic: Structural</p>
<p>Sponsors: John Locke, Henry Sidgwick, John Stuart Mill, John Maynard Keynes, Mary Wollstonecraft, Judith Butler, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aguste Comte</p>
<p>Signatories: N/A&nbsp;</p>
<p>This directive describes the implementation of a new system that ensures both blocks/industry sectors of the populations and the population on a whole are represented in a fair manner. This directive includes both the implementation of the governmental system and a bill of rights to ensure the population&rsquo;s just treatment.</p>
<ol>
<li>This form of government will have a bicameral legislature, one group of representatives from the general population and another from free associations representing industrial sectors.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The &ldquo;General Council&rdquo; will be a parliamentary body made up of the representatives voted on by the general population and will be a part of the legislative branch. There will be 60 delegates in this council.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Industrial Council&rdquo; will be a parliamentary body made up of the representatives voted on by an industry's elections and will be a part of the legislative branch. The economy will be divided into industries and each industry will elect a certain number of delegates proportional to their employment records, not exceeding 60 total representatives.</li>
<li>Citizens reserve the right to propose any initiative to enact, amend, or repeal any law by petition, and also reserve the right to propose a referendum to amend or repeal any law passed by the legislature.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Proposed referendums and amendments must be discussed by parliaments as soon as 25% of the total population has pledged for such a measure.</li>
<li>Collected referendums will be presented through the quadratic voting system, so that individuals can prioritize voting on the issues which they care about most.</li>
</ol>
<li>The framers of this constitution present at the New State Committee will serve as the adjudicators of disputes related to this constitution. They will serve life terms and elect successors before their death. In the event of an unexpected death, the replacement will be determined by popular vote. Judiciaries are prohibited from serving in either house of legislature.</li>
<li>The possession of the role of Chancellor will be determined by the voting system as well as the Judiciary Branch.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>The Chancellor will be administering the debate in the legislative branches, and act as a tie-breaker if the need arises.</li>
</ol>
<li>Constitutionally protected rights and liberties can not be taken away or amended by a simple democratic majority vote.&nbsp;</li>
<li>c The Bill of Rights is amendable and the legislative branch has the ability.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>To amend the Bill of Rights, a 2/3rd majority in the Parliament must be reached, followed by a simple majority by direct popular vote. Finally, it must be ratified by the judiciary branch.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Bill of Rights:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The government shall not enforce legislation that violates freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of the press.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The government shall not enforce any legislation that will encroach on citizens&rsquo; jurisdiction and right over their own body.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Every citizen over the age of 18 reserves the right to vote.</li>
<li>The government will protect from and prevent discrimination regardless or class and wealth.</li>
<li>The government shall not prevent citizens and inhabitants from addressing their concerns.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The government cannot inflict cruel or unusual punishment on its citizens.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The government will not endorse any state religion or recognize divine mandate to power.</li>
<li>The government will not recognize any hereditary right to power, such as those afforded in aristocratic, oligarchic, and monarchic systems of government.</li>
<li>No voter suppression is allowed, including a poll tax in any form.</li>
<li>Measures will be enacted to ensure wealth does not corrupt the electorate.</li>
<li>The powers not delegated to the Nation by the Constitution are reserved to the people.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Directive 2</p>
<p>Sponsors: John Maynard Keynes, Mary Wollstonecraft, Henry Sidgwick, John Locke, J.S Mill</p>
<p>Signatories: N/A</p>
<p>This directive establishes a primarily free-market economy with government-owned infrastructure necessities. The government will start helping companies become successful by removing tax for the first 10 years of the company&rsquo;s start up.</p>
<p>Currency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fiat currency will be printed by the government with values based on the base 10 system down to a 0.10 value.</li>
<li>The paper money will be called Thales and the coins will be named Platos</li>
<li>These will be printed by the national government at a nationally owned mint.</li>
</ol>
<p>Inflation:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>A federal reserve system shall be established in order to regulate and control inflation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The government will enact fiscal and monetary policy that encourages growth of all sectors of the economy without increasing inflation. The government will work to decrease aggregate demand, by spending less and raising taxes--this works to curb inflation and ensure that the government is not operating in a deficit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Debt and surplus</p>
<ol>
<li>Generally speaking, the government should avoid deficit spending. However, in a case of recession, the legislature is permitted to spend money in order to create jobs and provide wages. Once the economy is back to &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; the government&rsquo;s first priority is to get rid of the deficit.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li>All necessities are publicly owned: water, electricity, transportation, Internet, etc.</li>
<li>Deficit spending is allowed, provided that there is a real, not cosmetic need for improved infrastructure. This will be decided by the legislature.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Taxation:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Flat rate taxes--a percentage of income will automatically go towards taxes.</li>
<li>The tax rate will be flexible, based on if the economy is in a phase of growth or recession. The tax rate will be reevaluated by the legislature biennially.</li>
<li>Estate tax of 25% will apply to any wealth inherited,</li>
<ol>
<li>Inherited defined as any wealth gains as of a will, next of kin-clauses</li>
</ol>
<li>Tariffs will be regulated by the legislature in order to protect industries and raise funds</li>
<li>Taxation will be, temporarily, until our economy is industrially developed, only levied on the individual and domestic Corporations are exempt from taxation.</li>
<ol>
<li>After 10 years a special committee in the government will reassess the institution of taxes on corporations if they are thriving enough</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Regulations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The government will create an antitrust law that disbands monopolies</li>
<ol>
<li>No price discrimination if it lessens competition to an extreme</li>
<li>Forbids any sort of &ldquo;exclusive dealing&rdquo; sales: once a purchase is made, the seller may not forbid the purchaser from dealing with competitors</li>
<li>No mergers or acquisitions that remove a majority of competition</li>
</ol>
<li>The government will legalize unions and implement workers&rsquo; protection laws.</li>
<li>Child (under 16) labor will be banned and there will be no exceptions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Otherwise, the government will allow the economy to function like a free market driven by competition and self-interest.</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<ol>
<li>They will be attached directly to the ship and will not be able to be removed and brought onto the Island</li>
<ol>
<li>A 100 meter exclusion zone will be required of all armed vessels from the nearest shore.</li>

</ol>
<hr>
<p>Directive 4</p>
<p>Sponsors:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signatories:</p>
<p>The goal of our nation is to increase international recognition and ensure the happiness of our inhabitants through immigration, equal and free trade, and ____ education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immigration system:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are welcomers of immigration but there are certain guidelines to immigrate</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>A well-defined immigration policy that will encourage skilled people to migrate and support innovation in the field of technology, science, philosophy etc.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>There will be different limitations, thresholds, and background checks before accepting them in our country.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>Immigrants go-through a broad philosophy and civics course, covering various periods of philosophical study before they can become naturalized citizens.</li>
<ol>
<li>This will be an entirely optional government funded course at no cost to citizen-prospects</li>
<li>All rights of citizens excluding voting, and federal subsidy shall be held by non-citizen immigrants until they complete the course, at which time they will assume full citizenship.</li>
</ol>
<li>Families of current citizens or immigrants may immigrate to our country after thorough background checks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Offer an immigration process for educational immigrants who are entering our country for education purposes (ex. College offered etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Citizenship:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Citizenship is based on jus sanguinis, determined through where the parents were born or where the discussed individual was born- if the latter, the former, or both were born within the bounds of our nation, they are automatically citizens.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Trade:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The broad approach of the government towards trade shall be one of free trade, based on comparative advantages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Infant industry policy should be implemented</li>
<ol>
<li>The government should engage in trade protectionism (through tariffs, quotas, etc) in order to protect our new domestic industries from foreign competition.&nbsp;</li>
<li>After they are developed, as much government protectionism as possible should be abolished.&nbsp;</li>
<li>After the stage of infant industry policy, free trade policies, based on comparative advantage should be enacted.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>In the context of trade between our country and another in which each country produces and exports one of two products while the other country produces and exports the other product (let&rsquo;s say we export cloth and another country exports linen), it would be beneficial to our country to tax the product we are exporting.</li>
<ol>
<li>Although this policy would be economically beneficial, it should be implemented prudently and only in certain situations as it can create tension between our nation and other countries.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>All trades will need to yield utility and should be looked at as Equal Trade/Fair Trade that generates value for all sides of the trade.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>To encourage diplomatic relations, we will send our ethical diplomats to represent our country at the international level</li>
<li>Involve our country in the United Nations to make allies and get involved with humanitarian and environmental issues within the UN.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Create strong diplomatic relations with countries where we can trade equally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>We will implement an Education Plan as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The first stage of this plan is with the assumption of the absence of formal educational institutions. Here, we encourage our citizens to study abroad, and to take advantage of online instruction. Furthermore, we will pay small stipends for researchers, natural citizens of our country, to collaborate with highly ranked existing universities, and government-funded laboratories abroad. Foreign winners of Rhodes, Marshall and similar research grants will be given free room and board to incentivize their relocation.</em></p>
<p><em>For the second stage of the plan, we will construct an extremely prestigious, world-renown university out of this intellectual and human capital. We will appeal to international and world-renown faculty, particularly with respect to open science and academic reform. We will pursue a policy of open paper access and uphold tenets of multicultural and objective science.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We would support the construction of research facilities with government grants and the blossoming of science &amp; technical institutions on the island. For example, like how Switzerland has CERN for high speed particle research. This would encourage scientists to come to our island and solidify our reputation as an intellectual haven.</em></p>
<p><em>We can look into the possibility of specializing in particle research, including partnerships with CERN and the ice cube neutrino lab. These institutions are similar geographically and serve as models for our own development.</em></p>
<p><em>However, we should also prioritize becoming a philosophical powerhouse. Major philosophical research is currently focused around American and European institutions, such as the University of Pittsburgh and the Oxbridge universities. This has often been criticized for, respectively, biases in continental and eurocentric, analytical, philosophy. A center for philosophy established in Antarctica would bridge cultural barriers, and allow for more objective and holistic sociological and historiographical perspectives.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>There are several concrete reasons for philosophical research being based out of an Antarctic island. For one, the modern development of society on the island itself is fascinating. For another, the climate and location of the island allow researchers to work uninterrupted. Other research focuses could be on the psychology of extreme isolation, exposure to adverse conditions, and sound.</em></p>

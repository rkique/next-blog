<h1>
 Space Logic Lemmas
</h1>

<p>Here I will introduce some basic proof structures in an intuitive format, namely that of circles. It's borrowing a lot and perhaps scratching the surface of theories With Names, but I think these results on their own are very fun, self-contained, and intuitive. </p>

<h1>Everything*</h1>

<h1> A </h1>
<img src="pf-images/just-A.png">

<h1>A and B</h1>

<p>The first example here is set intersection. Given sets A and B, their intersection is all of the elements in both set A and in set B. This is the overlapping area in a world between A and B. </p>

<h1> A implies B</h1>
With the use of "implies", we have moved out of statements <i>in</i> worlds to statements <i>about</i> worlds. We are not looking at areas within a world. We are talking about comparing areas across worlds. In every world with A, we have B.

<h1> Not A</h1>
<img src="pf-images/not-A.png">

<h1> Not B</h1>
<img src="pf-images/not-B.png">

<h1> not B implies not A</h1>
<img src="pf-images/not-B-implies-not-A.png">

<p>
This is the intuitive explanation for the contrapositive. Not B encompasses Not A because A encompasses B. 
This is like downward entailment in semantics, and the basis for the mathematical contrapositive proof method.

<h1>Reading notes on <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> by Thomas S. Kuhn</h1>

<h2 id="meta">meta</h2>
<p>Thomas S. Kuhn was a professor emeritus of linguistics and philosophy at MIT. 
This book was considered one of &quot;The Hundred Most Influential Books Since the Second World War&quot;. It was also named &quot;a landmark in intellectual history&quot; by <em>Science</em>.</p>
<h2 id="opening">opening</h2>
<p>a better history of science could create a significant revision of the way we see it today. However, textbooks are &quot;persuasive and pedagogic&quot;: they focus on achievements and almost always mislead readers.</p>
<p>Science textbooks pretend like the theories, observations, and laws within them are simply the results if we apply the scientific method to the natural world. If this is indeed true, scientific development can be simply be seen as a process in which items are added incrementally to a &quot;constellation&quot; of facts.</p>
<p>However, this is not true. </p>
<p>Many now disproven scientific theories --aristotelian dynamics, phlogistical chemistry, and caloric thermodynamics are examples -- arose from the scientific process much in the same way things we accept as fact today did. </p>
<p>We cannot say that these theories are myths. Otherwise, we would also have to accept that current knowledge is also myths because they are derived from the same principles of scientific research.</p>
<p>Thus, &quot;out-of-date theories are not in principle unscientific because they have been discarded&quot;. If these theories -- obvious dead ends -- were in fact a part of the scientific process, then we cannot honestly view the scientific history as a process of accumulation.</p>
<p>Thus, we have a &quot;historiographical revolution&quot;: focused on integrity, and more amenable to viewing past mainstream opinions -- for example, the anti-Galileo mainstream -- &quot;maximum internal coherence&quot; and closest possible fit to nature.</p>
<p>This revolution in the way we view science has several implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;the insufficiency of methodological directives, by themselves to dictate a unique substantive conclusion to many sorts of scientific questions. Instructed to examine electrical or chemical phenomena, the man who is ignorant of these fields but knows what it is to be scientific may legitimately reach any number of incompatible conclusions&quot;. <ul>
<li>Subjective prior knowledge and perceived importance of various experimental results end up being &quot;essential determinants of scientific development&quot;.</li>
<li>Thus, competing schools of thought are often all scientific yet have fundamentally different philosophies of viewing the world. &quot;Effective research scarcely begins before a scientific community thinks it has acquired firm answers to questions lik the following: What are the fundamental entities of which the universe is composed? How do these interact with each other and with the senses? What questions may be legitimately asked about such entities and what techniques employed in seeking solutions?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This philosophy is often embedded in the <em>educational</em> initiation of students:<blockquote>
<p>&quot;research as a strenuous and devoted attempt to force nature into the conceptual boxes supplied by professional education&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>&quot;Normal science&quot; is predicated on the assumption that a scientific community knows what the world is like. When anomalies fail to be explained away, normal science goes through the 5 stages of denial and then a scientific revolution is born!</li>
</ul>
<p>... For the [practicioners of normal science], the new theory implies a change in the rules governing the prior practice of normal science.... that is why a new theory, however special its range of application, is seldom or never just an increment to what is already known. Its assimilation... is an intrinsically revolutionary process.</p>
<h2 id="epic-interdisciplinary-defense">epic interdisciplinary defense</h2>
<p>very cool</p>
<p>He goes on to say that the distinction between &quot;the context of discovery&quot; (science) and &quot;the context of justification&quot; (history) are not &quot;elementary logical or methodological distinctions&quot;, instead only &quot;integral parts of a traditional set of substantive answers to the very questions upon which they have been deployed&quot;, namely: what is science? </p>
<p>This makes them &quot;parts of a theory and, by doing so, subjects them to the same scrutiny regularly applied to theories in other fields&quot;, Then, using scientific langauge: &quot;How could history of science fail to be a source of phenomena to which theories about knowledge may legitimately be asked to apply&quot; </p>
<h2 id="paradigms">paradigms</h2>
<p>Acquisition of a paradigm and of the more esoteric type of research it permits is a sign of maturity in the development of any given scientific field -- it permits a group of normal scientists to work from shared fundamentals</p>
<p>Example: theory of optics
Recently, we have the light <em>as photons</em>: quantum-mechanical entities which exhibit properties of waves and properties of particles. (Planck, Einstein)</p>
<p>Before:  light <em>as transverse wave motion</em> (Young and Fresnel)
Before: light as <em>material corpuscles</em>
No period between remote antiquity and the end of the seventeenth century exhibited a single generally accepted view about the nature of light.</p>
<p>Normal science is directed to the articulation of those phenomena and theories that hte paradigm already supplies.</p>
<p>Three foci for factual science:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constants which are useful in solving a large variety of problems (periods, gravity, compressibility, boiling points etc. ). Increasing the accuracy and scope is large part of experimental and observational science.</li>
<li>``</li>
</ul>

<p>For my MATH-1001 final project, I will introduce some basic proof
structures in an intuitive format, that of overlapping geometric shapes. There are problems with this form of visualization (it can be cumbersome or misleading) but also some great strengths.</p>
<p>While much of the content here might be seen as prerequisites for a
theory, I think these results are interesting in their own right.
Furthermore, they are self-contained, making them perfect for
analysis.</p>
<p>I originally drew up sketches for equivalence and induction as well, but found those to sacrifice too much detail for too little intuition. In lieu of these, I expand on some quantifier logic that benefits greatly from the geometric approach. </p>
<p>Form follows function.</p>
<h3 id="everything">Everything</h3>
<p>Everything is the set containing everything of interest. I promise
this is going somewhere.</p>
<p><img class="single" src="sll-images/nothing.png"></p>
<h3 id="a">A</h3>
<p>We draw the set A as a circle. I’ve tried other approaches but
haven’t found anything that works as well; for inclusions and
intersections, circles are the most suggestive of a set. Squiggles look
like you’re trying to call attention to them, triangles, squares, and
hexagons fail miserably at suggesting intersection, etc.</p>
<p><img class="single" src="sll-images/A.png"></p>
<h3 id="not-a">Not A</h3>
<p>Let’s say we have A as above. We also can describe not A, <span
class="math inline">\({\sim} A\)</span>, as everything without A,
producing the hole shape below.</p>
<p><img class="single" src="sll-images/not.png"></p>
<h3 id="a-intersect-b">A intersect B</h3>
<p>One classic of Venn diagrams is set intersection. Given sets <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, their intersection <span
class="math inline">\(A \cap B\)</span> is all of the elements in both
set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and set <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This is depicted as the overlapping
area between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img class="single" src="sll-images/intersect.png"></p>
<h3 id="direct-proof-a-implies-b">Direct Proof: A implies B</h3>
<p>Here, we have the first way to express a statement, the direct proof
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>. In every world we
have <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
encircles <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that there is a difference between <span
class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span> etc. and <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>. The first examples are
description <em>within</em> a world, while the second is a relation
<em>about</em> a world.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/direct.png"></p>
<p>Here are examples of A implies B:</p>
<p>In every world where <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> divides
<span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>In every world where <span class="math inline">\(x^2 = 4\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(x = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In each, we go from a statement <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to a more general statement <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. It is not necessary that <span
class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span>, however; the two
examples above show this.</p>
<h3 id="contrapositive-not-b-implies-not-a">Contrapositive: Not B
implies not A</h3>
<p>Here is an explanation for the contrapositive proof. The
contrapositive is another way to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>. It says that if we prove
that <span class="math inline">\({\sim} B \rightarrow {\sim} A\)</span>,
we are really proving the same thing. This does not feel intuitive.</p>
<p>However, we can make it clear with diagrams. If we have the
direct proof <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, it is
the same as saying that <span class="math inline">\({\sim} B \rightarrow
{\sim} A\)</span>. That is, claiming <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> encircles <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is really the same as claiming <span
class="math inline">\({\sim}A\)</span> encircles <span
class="math inline">\({\sim}B\)</span>. A statement must be claiming
<em>something</em>, which is why in each approach we start with the
smaller shapes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\({\sim} B\)</span>. It is our task during the proof
to show that this smaller shape is encircled by the larger one.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/direct.png">
<img src="sll-images/contrapositive.png"></p>
<p>Because defining what something <em>isn’t</em> is the same as
defining what it <em>is</em>, our two approaches end up showing the same
thing.</p>

<p>Credit to <a
href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18908/the-difference-between-upward-and-downward-entailment">Natalie
Clarius on Linguistics Stack Exchange</a> for the text of some of the
examples here.</p>
<p>Here is a case I realized could be described with the same diagrams
as above. In linguistics, <code>all, some, no, most, many ...</code> are
known as quantifiers. Sentences with quantifiers usually assign
relations between two sets, the restriction A and the body B.</p>
<p>When we say <code>All women sang loudly</code>, we are assigning a
relation between those who are <code>women</code> (the restriction A)
and those who <code>sang loudly</code> (the body B).</p>
<p>The terms may be a little confusing. The body of the sentence is
<code>sang loudly</code> because the essential message of the sentence
is that <em>someone</em> sang loudly; hence, it is the body. The
restriction limits those involved to women.</p>
<p>Some quantifiers are known as upward entailing. They are upward
entailing in the restriction (A), and downward entailing in the body
(B). One example is the quantifier <code>all</code>.</p>
<p><code>all</code> is considered to be <em>upward entailing</em> in the
body, because we may widen <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>
loosen the body (going from those who sang loudly, to those who sang).
We have the entailment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All women sang loudly &gt; All women sang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Illustrated, this says that one implication implies another (for
convenience, each implication is now a single image, where the smaller
shape implies the larger). The implication <span class="math inline">\(A
\rightarrow B\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
B&#39;\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(B&#39;\)</span> is
larger:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/all_up.png"></p>
<p>And <code>all</code> is <em>downward entailing</em> in the
restriction, because we may make smaller <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> tighten the subject (going from
women, to young women) and still have it be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All women sang loudly &gt; All young women sang loudly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see a different implication <span class="math inline">\(A
\rightarrow B\)</span> implying <span class="math inline">\(A&#39;
\rightarrow B\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span> is smaller:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/all_down.png"></p>
<h3 id="downward-entailing-environments">downward entailing
environments</h3>
<p>Other quantifiers are known as downward entailing. They are downward
entailing in both the restriction (A) and body (B). One example is the
quantifier <code>no</code>.</p>
<p><em>Unlike</em> <code>all</code>, <code>no</code> is downward
entailing in the body, because we may make smaller <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> <em>tighten</em> the body (going
from those who sang, to those who sang loudly) and still have it be
true. We can see this clearly when we think of the statement
<code>no women sang</code> as <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
{\sim} B\)</span>, where the restriction and body are disjoint. We see
that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span> implies
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B&#39;\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(B&#39;\)</span> is smaller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No women sang &gt; No women sang loudly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="sll-images/no_down.png"></p>
<p>Like <code>all</code>, <code>no</code> is also downward entailing in
the restriction, because we may make smaller <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> <em>tighten</em> the restriction
(going from women, to young women), and still have it be true. We see
that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span> implies
<span class="math inline">\(A&#39; \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span> is smaller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No women sang &gt; No young woman sang.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="sll-images/no_up.png"></p>
<h3 id="geometric-interpretation">Geometric Interpretation</h3>
<p>Our diagrams can help us determine exactly how statements with
<code>all</code> and <code>no</code> differ.</p>
<p>In <code>all</code>, the body (B) is <em>inclusive</em> of A: <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>.</p>
<p>In <code>no</code>, the body (B) is <em>exclusive</em> of A: <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Simply by looking at the shapes, we can see that <code>all</code> is
upwards entailing in the body, while <code>no</code> is downwards
entailing in the body.</p>
<p>With <code>all</code>, we cannot tighten the body. In
<code>all women sang loudly</code>, tightening <code>sang loudly</code>
to <code>sang very loudly</code> means that B is no longer inclusive of
A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_inclusive2.png"></p>
<p>With <code>no</code>, we cannot loosen the body. In
<code>no women sang</code>, widening <code>sang</code> to
<code>made noise</code> means that B is no longer exclusive of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_exclusive2.png"></p>
<p>Likewise, we can also see geometrically that both kinds of statements
are downward entailing in the restriction.</p>
<p>In <code>all women sang loudly</code>, loosening <code>women</code>
to <code>persons</code> means that (B) is no longer inclusive of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_inclusive.png"></p>
<p>Likewise, in <code>no women sang loudly</code>, loosening
<code>women</code> to <code>persons</code> means that B is no longer
exclusive of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_exclusive.png"></p>
<!-- #### A and B
Before we show another major proof style, we want to introduce a minor notation. *and* $\land$ is what we get when we apply $\rightarrow$; like intersect $\cap$, it is a statement in a world. That is, when we apply $A \rightarrow B$, we obtain a world with a circle $A$ and a bigger circle $B$ around it.

<h3 id="proof-by-contradiction-a-and-not-b-implies-c-and-not-c">Proof by
Contradiction</h3>
<p>Like the contrapositive, proof by contradiction directly follows the
direct proof. In every world where we don’t have the direct implication
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, we must have <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim}B\)</span>. Our task is to
show that this ends up as <span class="math inline">\(C \land {\sim}
C\)</span>, which is impossible. Thus, we must have <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>.</p>
<p>We want to show that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
B\)</span> must be the case. That is, in every world we have <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/contra3.png"></p>
<p>So we assume <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
{\sim}B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/a_to_not_b.png"></p>
<p>Now, we show that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
{\sim}B\)</span> leads to <span class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow
{\sim}C\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/contra4.png"></p>
<p>This is a contradiction. It is true that we have previously seen
examples of disjoint shapes. But here, to claim that <span
class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow {\sim} C\)</span> is to say that C
is contained in <span class="math inline">\({\sim} C\)</span>! This is
definitely impossible. Because in every world in which we have <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span>, we reach <span
class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow {\sim} C\)</span>, we must have
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> instead.</p>
<p>This is less satisfying than showing the contrapositive, because it
is not as clear how we would go from <span class="math inline">\(A
\rightarrow {\sim}B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C
\rightarrow {\sim}C\)</span>. However, it does provide intuition about
<em>why</em> we cannot have <span class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow
{\sim}C\)</span>: a set can never be contained by its complement.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/contra5.png"></p>
<h3 id="a-if-and-only-if-b-lovers-quarrel-very-cute">A if and only if B
(lover’s quarrel, very cute)</h3>
<p>We can say A <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow B\)</span>
to mean <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span> at the same time.</p>
<p>If we have both <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span>, we must have A
contained by B and B contained by A. This is impossible … unless A and B
are the same! This is same rationale for proving equality by double set
inclusion.</p>

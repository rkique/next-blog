<p>For my proofwriting final, I will introduce some basic proof
structures in an intuitive format that you’ve probably seen before: that
of Venn Diagrams!</p>
<p>While much of the content here might be seen as prerequisites for a
theory, I think these results are interesting in their own right.
Furthermore, they are self-contained, making them perfect for
analysis.</p>
<p>Form follows function.</p>
<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<p>We draw the set A as a circle. I’ve tried other approaches but
haven’t found anything that works as well; for both inclusions and
intersections, circles are the most suggestive of a set. Squiggles look
like you’re trying to call attention to them, triangles, squares, and
hexagons fail miserably at suggesting intersection, etc.</p>
<p><img src="entailment/base.png"></p>
<h4 id="a-intersect-b">A intersect B</h4>
<p>One classic example is set intersection. Given sets <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, their intersection <span
class="math inline">\(A \cap B\)</span> is all of the elements in both
set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and set <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This is depicted as the overlapping
area between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="entailment/intersect.png"></p>
<h4 id="direct-proof-a-implies-b">Direct Proof: A implies B</h4>
<p>Here, we have the first way to express a statement, the direct proof
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>. In every world we
have <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
encircles <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that there is a difference between <span
class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span> etc. and <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>. The first examples are
description <em>within</em> a world, while the second is a relation
<em>about</em> a world. However, it is simpler to assume existence, so
the later diagrams will present direct implication in a single image.
Just as here, the left diagram implies the right.</p>
<p><img src="entailment/direct.png"></p>
<h4 id="contrapositive-not-b-implies-not-a">Contrapositive: Not B
implies not A</h4>
<p>Here is an intuitive explanation for the contrapositive proof, <span
class="math inline">\({\sim} B \rightarrow {\sim}A\)</span>. If we have
the implication <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, or
B encircling A, it is exactly the same as saying we will also have <span
class="math inline">\({\sim} B \rightarrow {\sim} A\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\({\sim}A\)</span> encircles <span
class="math inline">\({\sim}B\)</span>, because <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> encircles <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>

<p>Credit to <a
href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18908/the-difference-between-upward-and-downward-entailment">Natalie
Clarius on Linguistics Stack Exchange</a> for the text of the examples
given here.</p>
<p>In linguistics, <code>all, some, no, most, many ...</code> are known
as quantifiers. Sentences with quantifiers usually assign relations
between two sets, the restriction A and the body B.</p>
<p>When we say <code>All women sang loudly</code>, we are assigning a
relation between those who are <code>women</code> (the restriction A)
and those who <code>sang loudly</code> (the body B).</p>
<p>The terms may be a little confusing. The body is
<code>sang loudly</code> because the essential message of the sentence
is that <em>someone</em> sang loudly; the restriction limits those
involved to women.</p>
<p>Here, <code>all</code> is considered to be <em>upward entailing</em>
in the body, because we may widen or loosen the body (going from those
who sang loudly, to those who sang) and still have it be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All women sang loudly &gt; All women sang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Illustrated, this is much the same as <span class="math inline">\(B
\rightarrow A\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="entailment/all_up.png"></p>
<p>And <code>all</code> is <em>downward entailing</em> in the
restriction, because we may restrict or tighten the subject (going from
women, to young women) and still have it be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All women sang loudly &gt; All young women sang loudly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="entailment/all_down.png"></p>
<h3 id="inverted-entailing-environments">inverted entailing
environments</h3>
<p>Other quantifiers have the opposite.</p>
<p><code>no</code> is downward entailing in the body, because we may
widen or loosen the restriction (going from the set of women, to the set
of young women) and still have it be true. We can see this clearly as
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span> , where the
body and restriction are disjoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No women sang loudly &gt; No young women sang</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="entailment/no_down.png"></p>
<p>And upward entailing in the restriction. &gt; No women sang &gt; No
woman sang loudly.</p>
<p><img src="entailment/no_up.png"></p>
<h4 id="a-and-b">A and B</h4>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\land\)</span> is what we get when we
apply <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>; like <span
class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span>, it is a statement in a world. That
is, when we apply <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>,
we obtain a world with a circle <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
and a bigger circle <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> around
it.</p>
<h4 id="a-and-not-b">A and not B</h4>
<p>Armed with our new tool, we investigate a different approach from our
direct proof. Assume that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
B\)</span>. Then we can’t have <span class="math inline">\(A \land
{\sim}B\)</span>, a small circle and a bigger hole. It’s impossible to
be in both.</p>
<h4 id="c-and-not-c">C and not C</h4>
<p>What <span class="math inline">\(C \cap {\sim}C\)</span> says is, “be
both inside and outside the circle”. As we can see, this is impossible.
it’s quite like <span class="math inline">\(A \cap {\sim}B\)</span>, but
with A relaxed exactly to the size of B.</p>
<h4 id="proof-by-contradiction-a-and-not-b-implies-c-and-not-c">Proof by
Contradiction: A and not B implies C and not C</h4>
<p>Like the contrapositive, proof by contradiction directly follows the
direct proof. As we can see, if we have the direct implication <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, we will also have <span
class="math inline">\(A \cap {\sim}B \rightarrow C \cap {\sim}
C\)</span>. That is, if B encircles A, then our original world will be a
small circle <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a bigger hole
<span class="math inline">\({\sim}B\)</span>. However, <span
class="math inline">\(C \land {\sim}C\)</span> is is impossible. Thus,
we have <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="entailment/contra.png"> <img src="entailment/contra2.png">
<img src="entailment/contra3.png"></p>
<h4 id="a-if-and-only-if-b">A if and only if B</h4>
<p>We can say A <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow B\)</span>
to mean <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span> at the same time. If we
have both <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span>, we must have B
encircling A and A encircling B. This is impossible, unless A and B are
the same circle! This is same rationale for proving equality by double
set inclusion.</p>
<h4 id="equivalence-a-b-c">Equivalence: A &lt;&gt; B &lt;&gt; C</h4>
<p>If we have multiple statements we need to prove equivalence for, we
need only to prove <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow C\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow A\)</span> to prove <span
class="math inline">\(A \leftrightarrow B \leftrightarrow C\)</span>.
Below, we can see that the circles are in a donut shape which makes this
true.</p>
<h4 id="induction">Induction</h4>
<p>Hey, we got something fun to play with. It’s labeled “inductive
step”. Looks like a world with a circle <span
class="math inline">\(A_{n}\)</span> and a bigger circle <span
class="math inline">\(A_{n+1}\)</span> on it.</p>
<p>Oops, I dropped it and it opened! It’s an implication now, with a
small circle on one end and a big one on the other. Let’s see. If we
have a world and just one circle <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, we get…</p>
<p>Woah! A whole sequence of statements <span class="math inline">\(A_1,
A_2, \ldots, A_n\)</span>.</p>

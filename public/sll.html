<h1 id="space-logic-lemmas">Space Logic Lemmas</h1>
<p>For my proofwriting final, I will introduce some basic proof
structures in an intuitive format that you’ve probably seen before: that
of Venn Diagrams!</p>
<p>While much of the content here might be seen as prerequisites for a
theory, I think these results are interesting in their own right.
Furthermore, they are self-contained, making them perfect for
analysis.</p>
<p>Form follows function.</p>
<h3 id="everything">Everything</h3>
<p>Everything is the set containing everything of interest. I promise
this is going somewhere.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/nothing.png"></p>
<h3 id="a">A</h3>
<p>We draw the set A as a circle. I’ve tried other approaches but
haven’t found anything that works as well; for inclusions and
intersections, circles are the most suggestive of a set. Squiggles look
like you’re trying to call attention to them, triangles, squares, and
hexagons fail miserably at suggesting intersection, etc.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/base.png"></p>
<h3 id="not-a">Not A</h3>
<p>Let’s say we have A as above. We also can describe NOT A, <span
class="math inline">\({\sim} A\)</span>, as everything without A,
producing the hole shape below.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not.png"></p>
<h3 id="a-intersect-b">A intersect B</h3>
<p>One classic of Venn diagrams is set intersection. Given sets <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, their intersection <span
class="math inline">\(A \cap B\)</span> is all of the elements in both
set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and set <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This is depicted as the overlapping
area between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/intersect.png"></p>
<h3 id="direct-proof-a-implies-b">Direct Proof: A implies B</h3>
<p>Here, we have the first way to express a statement, the direct proof
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>. In every world we
have <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
encircles <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that there is a difference between <span
class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span> etc. and <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>. The first examples are
description <em>within</em> a world, while the second is a relation
<em>about</em> a world.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/direct.png"></p>
<p>Here are examples of A implies B:</p>
<p>In every world where <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> divides
<span class="math inline">\(2x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>In every world where <span class="math inline">\(x^2 = 4\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(x = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In each, we go from a statement <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to a more general statement <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. It is not necessary that <span
class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span>, however; the two
examples above show this.</p>
<h3 id="contrapositive-not-b-implies-not-a">Contrapositive: Not B
implies not A</h3>
<p>Here is an explanation for the contrapositive proof. The
contrapositive is another way to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>. It says that if we prove
that <span class="math inline">\({\sim} B \rightarrow {\sim} A\)</span>,
we are really proving the same thing. This does not feel intuitive.</p>
<p>However, we can make it more clear with diagrams. If we have the
direct proof <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, it is
the same as saying that <span class="math inline">\({\sim} B \rightarrow
{\sim} A\)</span>. That is, claiming <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> encircles <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is really the same as claiming <span
class="math inline">\({\sim}A\)</span> encircles <span
class="math inline">\({\sim}B\)</span>. A statement must be claiming
<em>something</em>, which is why in each approach we start with the
smaller shapes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\({\sim} B\)</span>. It is our task during the proof
to show that this smaller shape is encircled by the larger one.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/direct.png">
<img src="sll-images/contrapositive.png"></p>
<p>Because defining what something <em>isn’t</em> is the same as
defining what it <em>is</em>, our two approaches end up showing the same
thing.</p>

<h3 id="upward-entailing-environments">upward entailing
environments</h3>
<p>Credit to <a
href="https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/18908/the-difference-between-upward-and-downward-entailment">Natalie
Clarius on Linguistics Stack Exchange</a> for the text of some of the
examples here.</p>
<p>Here is a case I realized could be described with the same diagrams
as above. In linguistics, <code>all, some, no, most, many ...</code> are
known as quantifiers. Sentences with quantifiers usually assign
relations between two sets, the restriction A and the body B.</p>
<p>When we say <code>All women sang loudly</code>, we are assigning a
relation between those who are <code>women</code> (the restriction A)
and those who <code>sang loudly</code> (the body B).</p>
<p>The terms may be a little confusing. The body of the sentence is
<code>sang loudly</code> because the essential message of the sentence
is that <em>someone</em> sang loudly; hence, it is the body. The
restriction limits those involved to women.</p>
<p>Here, <code>all</code> is considered to be <em>upward entailing</em>
in the body, because we may widen <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> loosen the body (going from those
who sang loudly, to those who sang) and still have it be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All women sang loudly &gt; All women sang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Illustrated, this is exactly the implication <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/all_up.png"></p>
<p>And <code>all</code> is <em>downward entailing</em> in the
restriction, because we may make smaller <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> tighten the subject (going from
women, to young women) and still have it be true. Again, we see the
implication <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All women sang loudly &gt; All young women sang loudly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="sll-images/all_down.png"></p>
<h3 id="downward-entailing-environments">downward entailing
environments</h3>
<p>Other quantifiers are known as downward entailing environments. They
are downward entailing in the restriction (A) and body (B).</p>
<p>Unlike <code>all</code>, <code>no</code> is downward entailing in the
body, because we may make smaller <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> <em>tighten</em> the body (going
from those who sang, to those who sang loudly) and still have it be
true. We can see this clearly when we think of this kind of statement as
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span> , where the
restriction and body are disjoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No women sang &gt; No women sang loudly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="sll-images/no_down.png"></p>
<p>Like <code>all</code>, <code>no</code> is also downward entailing in
the restriction, because we may make smaller <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> <em>tighten</em> the restriction
(going from women, to young women), and still have it be true. Again, we
can think of this kind of statement as <span class="math inline">\(A
\rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No women sang &gt; No young woman sang.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="sll-images/no_up.png"></p>
<p>This geometric interpretation should shed light on how exactly
statements with <code>all</code> and <code>no</code> differ.</p>
<p>In <code>all</code>, the body (B) is <em>inclusive</em> of A: <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>.</p>
<p>In <code>no</code>, the body (B) is <em>exclusive</em> of A: <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Simply by looking at the shapes, we can see that both kinds of
statements are only downward entailing in the restriction. This is
because in both the inclusive <code>all</code> and exclusive
<code>no</code> cases, we may only tighten A. If we loosen A, the
quantifier may no longer be true.</p>
<p>In <code>all women sang loudly</code>, (B) is no longer
<em>inclusive</em> of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_inclusive.png"></p>
<p>And in <code>no women sang loudly</code>, B is no longer
<em>exclusive</em> of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_exclusive.png"></p>
<p>And we can also see geometrically that <code>all</code> is only
upwards entailing in the body, while <code>no</code> is only downwards
entailing in the body.</p>
<p>When it is inclusive in <code>all women sang loudly</code>, we may
only widen B.</p>
<p>If we tighten B, B might no longer be inclusive of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_inclusive2.png"></p>
<p>When it is exclusive in <code>no women sang</code>, we may only
tighten B.</p>
<p>If we widen B, B might no longer be exclusive of A:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/not_exclusive2.png"></p>
<!-- #### A and B
Before we show another major proof style, we want to introduce a minor notation. *and* $\land$ is what we get when we apply $\rightarrow$; like intersect $\cap$, it is a statement in a world. That is, when we apply $A \rightarrow B$, we obtain a world with a circle $A$ and a bigger circle $B$ around it. 

<img src="sll-images/and.png"> -->
<h4 id="proof-by-contradiction-a-and-not-b-implies-c-and-not-c">Proof by
Contradiction: A and not B implies C and not C</h4>
<p>Like the contrapositive, proof by contradiction directly follows the
direct proof. In every world where we don’t have the direct implication
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, we must have <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim}B\)</span>. Our task is to
show that this ends up as <span class="math inline">\(C \land {\sim}
C\)</span>, which is impossible. Thus, we must have <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>.</p>
<p>We want to show that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
B\)</span> must be the case. That is, in every world we have <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/contra3.png"></p>
<p>So we assume <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
{\sim}B\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/a_to_not_b.png"></p>
<p>Now, we show (somehow) that <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow
{\sim}B\)</span> leads to <span class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow
{\sim}C\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/contra4.png"></p>
<p>This is a contradiction. It is true that we have previously seen
examples of disjoint shapes. But here, to claim that <span
class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow {\sim} C\)</span> is to say that C
is contained in <span class="math inline">\({\sim} C\)</span>! This is
definitely impossible. Because in every world in which we have <span
class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow {\sim} B\)</span>, we reach <span
class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow {\sim} C\)</span>, we must have
<span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> instead.</p>
<p>This is less satisfying than showing the contrapositive, because it
is not clear how we would go from <span class="math inline">\(A
\rightarrow {\sim}B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(C
\rightarrow {\sim}C\)</span>. However, it does provide intuition about
<em>why</em> we cannot have <span class="math inline">\(C \rightarrow
{\sim}C\)</span>: a set can never be contained by its complement.</p>
<p><img src="sll-images/contra5.png"></p>
<h3 id="a-if-and-only-if-b-lovers-quarrel-very-cute">A if and only if B
(lover’s quarrel, very cute)</h3>
<p>We can say A <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow B\)</span>
to mean <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span> at the same time.</p>
<p>If we have both <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(B \rightarrow A\)</span>, we must have A
contained by B and B contained by A. This is impossible … unless A and B
are the same! This is same rationale for proving equality by double set
inclusion.</p>

The primary sampling frame for AmeriSpeak is the 2010 NORC National Frame, a multistage probability
sample that fully represents the U.S. household population.

This National Frame is comprised of:

PSU. 1,917 National Frame Areas. Each of which is an
- entire metropolitan area (made up of one or more counties),
- a county
- ... or a group of counties with a minimum population of 10,000.

From these 1,917 NFAs, we selected 126 of them, including 38 certainty NFAs, 60 urban NFAs, and 28 non-urban NFAs. The largest 38 NFAs, those with a population of at least 1,543,728 (0.5 percent of the 2010 Census U.S. population), were selected into the National Frame with certainty.

Important question: how are urban and non-urban NFAs selected?

Within these NFAs, we have groups, defined from Census tracts or block groups, where each segment contains at least 300 houses. To sample these groups, we did different things for certainty and non-certain NFAs.

For the certain NFAs, 896 groups was selected. If an SSU has more houses, it would be more likely to be selected. If a segment has less, it would be less likely to be selected.

From each of the urban NFAs, 8 groups were selected; for the rural NFAs, a sample of 5 groups were selected. This makes 60*8 = 480 urban groups and 28*5 = 140 rural groups. However, two rural groups in Montana were removed due to cost.

certain: 896
urban: 480
rural: 138

Now, for each of the houses in these groups, we look them up in the Postal Service. In the 123 groups where the address list isn't good enough, we enhance it with an in-person field listing. These houses comprise the National Frame.

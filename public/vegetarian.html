        <h2>Step 1. Cook for yourself.</h2>
        <p>That's it!</p>
        <p>List of things that are easy on vegetarian diet: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Everything is edible. </b> Even if you undercook something it will still be edible and not taste too bad.</li>
            <li><b>Abundance of low/ no-cook foods</b>. Tofu, scrambled eggs, peanut butter, stirfried vegetables, potatoes, pasta, rice, peanut butter toast, trail mix, protein drinks, fruits, beans, corn, salad, hashbrowns, tea/coffee/milk, premade soup, peanut butter pretzels etc.</li>
            <li><b>Cost</b>. These are not traditionally considered healthy items and do not get markups.</li>
            <li><b>Clean up</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>List of things that are difficult on non-vegetarian diet: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Food safety</b>: having a dedicated knife for red meat, a cutting board, and managing shelf life. </li>
            <li><b>Knowledge of recipes</b>. Just looking at vegetarian dishes there are still so many recipes I will never be able to try. </li>
            <li><b>Transporting uncooked food</b> from store to apartment. </li>
            <li><b>Food poisoning risks</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also eat frozen shrimp and salmon, beyond meat items, and normal dishes at restaurants. I don't really think of myself as a vegetarian, but I agree that consuming less meat is one of the most impactful choices you can make as a consumer. </p>

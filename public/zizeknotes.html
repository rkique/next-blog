<h1>Notes on The Sublime Object of Ideology (1989)</h1>

<p>The largely discredited line of psychoanalysis (Jung, Freud) is a theory indebted to Hegel&#39;s dialectics, or the conflict between two opposing forces. Zizek wants to redeem both psychoanalysis and hegel by looking at their interaction.</p>
<h2 id="1-how-did-marx-invent-the-symptom-">1: how did Marx invent the Symptom?</h2>
<p>Marx invented the notion of the Symptom, which is also present in Freud&#39;s work.
Why does this idea, originally conceived for the world of commodities, also appear in the analysis of dreams, hysterical phenomena, and so on?</p>
<p><em>This line of reasoning sounds sketchy to me by itself. If you define the idea of the Symptom yourself AS the common element to polemical critiques, you can of course find it everywhere you look.</em></p>
<p>The answer, Zizek claims, is that Marx and Freud&#39;s thinking shares many similarities. Both strive to avoid fetishistic fascination with &quot;content&quot; and to pierce into the &quot;secret&quot; of the form -- the form of commodities, the form of dreams: why does work assume the form of the value of a commodity? Why do our latent thoughts appear in the form of a dream?</p>
<p>Zizek summarizes what Freud says: these latent thoughts which appear in our dreams are NOT unconscious ones. They are entirely normal thoughts which can be articulated in everyday language. Furthermore, these thoughts are always present, often at the forefront of our consciousness. What is remarkable about a dream, what is essential to it, is the WORK that it does, in &quot;displacement and condensation&quot;, the translation of existing thoughts to images.</p>
<p>Freud says we misunderstand when we look for the &quot;secret of the dream&quot; in the actual latent content, which turn out to be disappointingly normal, perhaps unpleasant, thoughts. Instead, the truly repressed thoughts can be seen doing the WORK of the dream, that psychic process of taking thoughts and transforming them into content for the dream. </p>
<p>Those (unconscious/sexual) thoughts cannot actually be reduced to normal thinking because they have been repressed from infancy. As such, they have acquired no outlet during the process of child development and cannot be expressed in ordinary &quot;normal&quot; language.</p>
<p><em>These unconscious desires feel directly analogous to fashion aesthetics as ill defined, intensely motivating dreams which have acquired no outlet in human language.</em></p>
<p>In this sense, there are always three elements at play: the manifest dream-text, the latent dream-content, and the unconscious desire articulated in a dream.</p>
<p>And so, Freud says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The form of a dream or the form in which it is dreamt is used with quite surprising frequency for representing its concealed subject matter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zizek says Marx says the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="commodity-exchange-is-the-unconscious-of-objective-scientific-truth">commodity exchange is the unconscious of objective scientific truth</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;classical political economy is interested only in contents concealed behind the commodity-form,which is why it cannot explaint the true secret, not the secret behind the form but the secret <em>of</em> this form itself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must also examine the process by means of which the concealed content assumes such a form. As Marx says &quot;Whence, then, arises the enigmatic character of the product of labour, as soon as it assumes the form of commodities? Clearly from this form itself.&quot; </p>
<p>Alfred Sohn-Rethel, an economist at the Frankfurt School, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Political economy has indeed analysed value and its magnitude, however incompletely, and has uncovered the content concealed within these forms. But it has never once asked the question why this content has assumed that particular form, that is to say, why labour is expressed in value, and why the measurement of labour by its duration is expressed in the magnitude of the value of the product.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I&#39;m not sure I understand this part, because it seems to ask why we view labor as valuable, and the answer to that is that we value certain things and make efforts to get them.</em></p>
<p>His fundamental thesis says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the formal analysis of the commodity holds the key not only to the critique of political economy, but also to the historical explanation of the abstract conceptual mode of thinking and of the division of intellectual and manual labourr which came into existence with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, in the structure of the commodity-form it is possible to find the Kantian <em>transcendental subject</em>: the network of transcendental categories which constitute the a priori frame of &quot;objective&quot; scientific knowledge. [[transcendental idealism]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sohn Rethel came to the following conclusion: the apparatus of categories presupposed, implied by the scientific procedure ... is already present in the social effectivity and already at work in the act of commodity exchange. </p>
<p>Before thought could arrive at pure abstraction, the abstraction was already at work in the social effectivity of the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Money precedes science in the representation of pure quantity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before thought could arrive at the idea of a purely <em>quantitative</em> determination, a <em>sine qua non</em> of the modern science of nature, pure quantity was already at work in money, that commodity which renders possible the commensurability of the value of all other commodities notwithstanding their particular qualitative determination. </p>
<p>Before physics could articulate the notion of a purely abstract <em>movement</em> going on in geometric space... the social act of exchange had already realized such a &quot;pure&quot;, abstract movement. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early mathematical innovation: e.g. the concept of zero and negative numbers etc. evolve out of the transfer of property/tracking taxes? So the abstraction of exchange value in bartering was the original use for abstract conceptual thinking.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the commonplace, practical &quot;real abstraction&quot; found in market transactions is posited by Sohn-Rethel to be the &quot;unconsciousness&quot; of the transcendental subject, the support of objective-universal scientific knowledge. In other words, <em>putting your money where your mouth is akin to asserting a truth to be objective.</em></p>
